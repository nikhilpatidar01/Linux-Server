### **1. Simple Search (‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö)** üîç  
If you want to search the word "error" in a file, use the following command:
```bash
$ grep "error" myfile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 1: Error occurred in the system
Line 5: Critical error found in the logs
```
**Explanation**: This command will show the lines that contain the word "error."

---

### **2. Case-Insensitive Search (‡§ï‡•á‡§∏-‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ü‡§ø‡§µ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö)** üî†  
To search the word "error" in a case-insensitive manner (i.e., matching "Error", "ERROR", "ErRoR" as well), use the `-i` option:
```bash
$ grep -i "error" myfile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 1: Error occurred in the system
Line 2: This is an ERROR in the program
Line 5: Critical error found in the logs
Line 8: ErRoR detected in the module
```
**Explanation**: With the `-i` option, case (uppercase, lowercase) doesn't matter.

---

### **3. Search with Line Number (‡§≤‡§æ‡§á‡§® ‡§®‡§Ç‡§¨‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö)** üî¢  
To know which line contains the word "error", use the `-n` option:
```bash
$ grep -n "error" myfile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
1: Error occurred in the system
5: Critical error found in the logs
```
**Explanation**: The `-n` option will show the line numbers where the word "error" is found.

---

### **4. Invert Match (‡§ú‡•ã "error" ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§æ‡§á‡§®‡•á‡§Ç)** ‚õî  
To view the lines that do **not** contain the word "error", use the `-v` option:
```bash
$ grep -v "error" myfile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 3: Everything is running fine
Line 4: System is stable
Line 6: No issues found
```
**Explanation**: The `-v` option shows the lines that do not match "error."

---

### **5. Search in Multiple Files (‡§è‡§ï ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï ‡§´‡§º‡§æ‡§á‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö)** üìÇ  
To search the word "error" in multiple files (like `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`), use this command:
```bash
$ grep "error" file1.txt file2.txt
```
**Output**:
```
file1.txt: Error occurred in the system
file2.txt: Critical error found in the logs
file1.txt: Minor error detected in the report
```
**Explanation**: This command will show the matching lines for "error" in both files, along with the filename.

---

### **6. Recursive Search (‡§∞‡•á‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§µ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö)** üîÑ  
To search the word "error" in all files inside a directory, use the `-r` (recursive) option:
```bash
$ grep -r "error" /path/to/directory/
```
**Output**:
```
/path/to/directory/file1.txt: Error occurred in the system
/path/to/directory/subdir/file2.txt: Critical error found in the logs
```
**Explanation**: The `-r` option allows you to search recursively through all files in a directory.

---

### **7. Search Using Regular Expressions (‡§∞‡•á‡§ó‡•Å‡§≤‡§∞ ‡§è‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó)** üßë‚Äçüíª  
If you want to search both "error" and "failure" at the same time, you can use regular expressions:
```bash
$ grep -E "error|failure" myfile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 1: Error occurred in the system
Line 3: System failure detected
Line 5: Critical error found in the logs
```
**Explanation**: The `-E` option lets you search for multiple patterns at once.

---

### **8. Display Only Filenames (‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´ ‡§´‡§º‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ)** üìÇ  
If you only want to display the filenames that contain the word "error", use the `-l` option:
```bash
$ grep -l "error" *.txt
```
**Output**:
```
file1.txt
file2.txt
```
**Explanation**: The `-l` option will display only the filenames that contain the word "error", without showing the matching lines.

---

### **Output Coloring** üé®  
You can colorize the output of `grep` to highlight the matching patterns. To do this, simply add the `--color` option:

```bash
$ grep --color "error" myfile.txt
```

This will highlight the word "error" in the output in color, making it easier to spot. You can also use the `--color=auto` option to enable automatic coloring depending on the output's terminal capabilities.

---

### **Conclusion (‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑)** üéØ:  
The `grep` command is versatile and powerful, allowing you to search text, match patterns, perform case-insensitive searches, search across multiple files, use regular expressions, and recursively search directories. The addition of colorized output can make the results even easier to analyze, especially when dealing with large datasets or logs.

### **Syntax of grep Command in Unix/Linux** üñ•Ô∏è  
The basic syntax of the `grep` command is as follows:

```
grep [options] pattern [files]
```

Where:

- **[options]**: These are the command-line flags that modify the behavior of `grep`.  
- **[pattern]**: This is the regular expression you want to search for.  
- **[files]**: These are the files where you want to search for the pattern. You can specify multiple files to search at once.

### **Options Available in grep Command** ‚öôÔ∏è  

| **Options** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| -c | Displays only the count of lines that match the pattern. |
| -h | Shows matching lines without filenames. |
| -i | Ignores case when matching. |
| -l | Displays only the filenames. |
| -n | Displays the matched lines with their line numbers. |
| -v | Displays lines that do not match the pattern. |
| -e exp | Allows you to specify one or more patterns. |
| -f file | Takes patterns from a file, one per line. |
| -E | Treats the pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE). |
| -w | Matches only whole words. |
| -o | Displays only the matched part of the line. |
| -A n | Shows n lines after the matched line. |
