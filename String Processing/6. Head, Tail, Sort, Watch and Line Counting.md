### **STRING PROCESSING IN LINUX**

**Why is string processing used?**
String processing is commonly used to filter and extract specific parts of output from commands such as `ifconfig`, `ip a`, etc.

---

### **HEAD**

1. **`head` Command**  
   The `head` command is used to display the first few lines of a file. By default, it shows the first 10 lines.
   ```bash
   head 1.txt   # Displays the first 10 lines of 1.txt
   head -n 5 1.txt   # Displays the first 5 lines of 1.txt
   head -n 3 1.txt   # Displays the first 3 lines of 1.txt
   head -c 50 1.txt   # Displays the first 50 bytes of 1.txt
   ```

   You can also display the first few lines from multiple files:
   ```bash
   head 1.txt messages /var/log/centos.rep   # Displays first 10 lines from all three files
   ```

### **TAIL**   

2. **`tail` Command**  
   The `tail` command is used to display the last few lines of a file. It shows the last 10 lines by default.
   ```bash
   tail 1.txt messages passwd centos.rep   # Displays the last 10 lines of each file
   tail -f /var/log   # Displays the last 10 lines of log files and updates when new entries appear
   ```

### **WC**

1. **`wc` Command**  
   The `wc` command counts the lines, words, and bytes in a file.
   ```bash
   wc 1.txt   # Output: lines words bytes
   wc -l 1.txt   # Counts the number of lines
   wc -w 1.txt   # Counts the number of words
   wc -c 1.txt   # Counts the number of bytes
   ```

2. **Counting for Multiple Files**
   ```bash
   wc *   # Counts lines, words, and bytes for all files
   ls -1   # Lists files in the directory
   wc -l   # Counts the number of files
   ```

---
---
---

### **SORT**

1. **Basic Sorting**
   ```bash
   sort test1.txt   # Sorts lines alphabetically
   ```

2. **Additional Sort Options**
   - **Sort in numeric order (for numbers)**
     ```bash
     sort -h test1.txt   # Sorts numbers in ascending order
     ```

   - **Sort in reverse order**
     ```bash
     sort -r test1.txt   # Sorts lines in reverse order
     ```

   - **Sort randomly**
     ```bash
     sort -R test1.txt   # Sorts lines randomly
     ```

   - **Remove duplicates**
     ```bash
     sort test1.txt | uniq -c   # Removes duplicates and shows their count
     ```

3. **Sorting by Specific Columns**
   ```bash
   sort -k 2 test1.txt   # Sorts by the second column
   ```

4. **Handling Delimited Files**
   ```bash
   sort -t ',' -k 2 test1.txt   # Sorts by the second column of a comma-separated file
   ```

5. **Sorting by Month**
   ```bash
   sort -M test1.txt   # Sorts by month names
   ```

---
---
---

### **WATCH COMMAND**

- **Monitor the output of a command periodically**
  ```bash
  watch -n 5 date   # Displays the current date every 5 seconds
  watch -n 1 date   # Displays the current date every second
  ```

---
---
---

### **GREP**

1. **Basic Search**
   ```bash
   grep searchword filename   # Finds occurrences of 'searchword' in the file
   grep "root" /etc/passwd   # Finds 'root' in the /etc/passwd file
   ```

2. **Search in Multiple Files**
   ```bash
   grep root /etc/passwd /etc/shadow   # Finds 'root' in both files
   ```

3. **Ignore Case (Case-insensitive search)**
   ```bash
   grep -i root messages   # Finds both 'root' and 'Root'
   ```

4. **Search for Multiple Words**
   ```bash
   grep -E "(session|root|mounting)" var/log/messages   # Finds 'session', 'root', or 'mounting'
   ```

5. **Search for Words in the Same Line**
   ```bash
   grep "session" var/log/messages | grep root   # Finds lines containing both 'session' and 'root'
   ```

6. **Exclude a Word (Using `-v`)**
   ```bash
   grep "session" var/log/messages | grep -v root   # Finds lines with 'session' but not 'root'
   ```

7. **Search for a Word at the Beginning or End of a Line**
   - Word at the beginning of a line:
     ```bash
     grep "^root" var/log/messages   # Finds lines where 'root' appears at the start
     ```
   - Word at the end of a line:
     ```bash
     grep "root.$" var/log/messages   # Finds lines where 'root' appears at the end
     ```

8. **Search by Date**

### **AWK**

**: An Advanced Text Processing Tool**

AWK is a powerful tool used for processing and analyzing text. It can modify file content, unlike commands such as `cut`, `sort`, `grep`, and `cat`, which are used mainly for text extraction and viewing. AWK allows you to perform operations on file contents based on patterns and conditions.

### Basic Structure of an AWK Command:
An AWK command typically follows this syntax:
```
awk 'pattern {action}' filename
```
- **Pattern**: The condition that determines when the action is performed.
- **Action**: The task that AWK performs if the pattern matches.

For example:
```
awk '{print $0}' filename
```
This command will print all lines of the file because `$0` refers to the entire line.

### Using a Custom Delimiter:
AWK allows you to specify a delimiter for field separation in a file. The default delimiter is a space or tab, but you can set a custom one using the `-F` option.

For instance:
```
awk -F: '{print $1}' filename
```
Here, `-F:` sets the colon `:` as the field separator. `$1` refers to the first field of each line.

### Specifying Multiple Fields:
To print multiple fields, you can list them individually:
```
awk -F: '{print $1, $2, $3}' filename
```
You cannot use a range like `$1-$3` directly. Instead, specify each field individually (e.g., `$1, $2, $3`).

### Filtering with AWK:
AWK also lets you filter content based on patterns. For example, to extract the second field of each line from the `ifconfig` command output:
```
ifconfig | awk '{print $2}'
```

You can also apply conditions to select lines that match a certain pattern. For example, to print the second field of lines containing the string `inet`:
```
ifconfig | awk '/inet /{print $2}'
```
---

### **AWK with BEGIN and END Blocks**

AWK allows you to add custom text at specific points in the command execution using the `BEGIN` and `END` blocks. These blocks allow you to define actions that happen before processing the data (BEGIN) and after processing is complete (END). These are useful for formatting output or adding headers/footers to the results.

#### Example 1: Printing a Header and Data with BEGIN
If you want to print custom text before displaying the actual data, you can use the `BEGIN` block:
```
command = ifconfig | awk 'BEGIN{print "== IP Address =="} /inet /{print $2}'
```
**Output:**
```
== IP Address ==
192.168.1.40
127.0.0.1
```
In this command:
- The `BEGIN` block prints `"== IP Address =="` before any data is processed.
- The `/inet /{print $2}` part prints the second field (the IP address) of the lines containing `inet`.

#### Example 2: Adding a Footer with END
You can also use the `END` block to add custom text after the data processing is done. For example:
```
command = ifconfig | awk 'BEGIN{print "== IP Address =="} /inet /{print $2} END{print "====="}'
```
**Output:**
```
== IP Address ==
192.168.1.40
127.0.0.1
=====
```
In this command:
- The `BEGIN` block prints the header `"== IP Address ==""`.
- The `/inet /{print $2}` part prints the IP addresses.
- The `END` block prints `"====="` after the data has been processed.

#### Example 3: Custom Text with `echo` Command
You can use AWK with the `echo` command to add a custom message at the beginning and end of the output:
```
command = echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== Start ==="} {print $0} END {print "-- Stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== Start ===
one two three four
-- Stop --
```
In this command:
- The `BEGIN` block prints `"=== Start ==="`.
- The `{print $0}` part prints the entire input line (`$0` refers to the whole line).
- The `END` block prints `"-- Stop --"` after the input has been processed.


The `BEGIN` and `END` blocks in AWK are useful for:
- Printing a header before the main output (`BEGIN` block).
- Adding a footer or final message after the data processing (`END` block).

  ---

### **DELIMITERS**

In AWK, you can include custom delimiters when printing output. This allows you to control the format and how the fields are separated in the printed result. You can add separators like spaces, commas, slashes, or any other character to customize the output. This is helpful for organizing the printed fields or making the output more readable.

Here are a few examples:

#### Example 1: Using a Dash (" - ") Between Fields
You can print two fields with a dash between them:
```
command → echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== start ==="} {print $1, " - ", $2} END {print "-- stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== start ===
one - two
-- stop --
```
- In this example:
  - The `BEGIN` block prints `"=== start ==="`.
  - The `{print $1, " - ", $2}` part prints the first and second fields separated by a dash (`-`).
  - The `END` block prints `"-- stop --"` after the data.

#### Example 2: Using a Slash (" / ") Between Fields
You can print two fields with a slash between them:
```
command → echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== start ==="} {print $1, " / ", $2} END {print "-- stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== start ===
one / two
-- stop --
```
- Here, the fields are separated by a slash (`/`).

#### Example 3: Using a Newline (" /n ") Between Fields
You can add a newline between two fields by using `/n` to break the output into separate lines:
```
command → echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== start ==="} {print $1, " /n ", $2} END {print "-- stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== start ===
one /n two
-- stop --
```
- In this case, `/n` will not actually produce a new line. If you want a true newline, just use `\n` in the print statement:
```
command → echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== start ==="} {print $1, "\n", $2} END {print "-- stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== start ===
one 
two
-- stop --
```
- Here, `\n` correctly creates a new line between the fields.

#### Example 4: Using an Underscore (" _ ") Between Fields
You can print fields with an underscore between them:
```
command → echo "one two three four" | awk 'BEGIN {print "=== start ==="} {print $1, " _ ", $2} END {print "-- stop --"}'
```
**Output:**
```
=== start ===
one _ two
-- stop --
```
- In this example, the fields are separated by an underscore (`_`).

### **WORKING with AWK**

AWK is a powerful tool for text processing, allowing you to extract and manipulate specific fields from text files or commands. Below are some useful examples that show how you can work with AWK to process text and fields in different ways.


#### 1. **Accessing Specific Fields**

To print specific fields from an input, you can use AWK to reference fields by number.

- **Print the first field:**
    ```
    command → echo "armour infosec" | awk '{print $1}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    armour
    ```
    - This prints the first field, which is "armour".

- **Print the second field:**
    ```
    command → echo "armour infosec" | awk '{print $2}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    infosec
    ```
    - This prints the second field, which is "infosec".

---

#### 2. **Updating Values in Fields**

You can update a field's value before printing it using AWK.

- **Update the first field:**
    ```
    command → echo "armour infosec" | awk '{$1="ARMOUR"; print $1}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    ARMOUR
    ```
    - Here, the first field is updated to "ARMOUR" and printed.

---


#### 3. **Matching Specific Values**

You can filter specific values by using conditional statements in AWK.

- **Print the second field where the first field matches "inet" (e.g., from `ifconfig` output):**
    ```
    command → ifconfig | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    192.168.1.40
    127.0.0.1
    ```
    - This prints the second field (IP addresses) where the first field is "inet".

- **Print lines where the first field does not match "inet":**
    ```
    command → ifconfig | awk '$1!="inet" {print $2}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    (Lines that don't have "inet")
    ```

---


#### 4. **Using Field Separators**

AWK allows you to specify field separators to process files with different delimiters. For example, you can use a colon (`:`) separator to work with `/etc/passwd`.

- **Print lines where the first field is "root":**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$1=="root" {print $0}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    ```
    - This command prints lines where the first field is "root".

- **Print lines where the first field is not "root":**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$1!="root" {print $0}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    (Lines where the first field is not "root")
    ```

---


#### 5. **Working with Numbers and Fields**

AWK can also handle numeric comparisons for fields.

- **Print lines where the third field is "0" (e.g., from `/etc/passwd`):**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3==0 {print $0}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    ```

- **Print lines where the third field is greater than or equal to "1000":**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3>=1000 {print $0}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    (Lines with UID >= 1000)
    ```

- **Print lines where the third field is greater than "0":**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3>0 {print $0}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    (Lines with UID > 0)
    ```

---


#### 6. **Using AWK with Files**

AWK can process files line by line and can output data in a specific format using `BEGIN` and `END` blocks.

- **Using `BEGIN` and `END` to print a header and footer with a file:**
    ```
    command → vim test.txt
    BEGIN { print "passwd file" }
    { print $1, "home at", $6 }
    END { print "END passwd file" }
    
    command → awk -F: -f test.txt /etc/passwd
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    passwd file
    root home at /root
    user1 home at /home/user1
    END passwd file
    ```

---


#### 7. **Arithmetic Operations with AWK**

AWK supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Print the MAC address from `ifconfig` using AWK (find lines that start with "ether"):**
    ```
    command → ifconfig | awk '$1=="ether" {print $2}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    (MAC address)
    ```

---


#### 8. **Working with Field Count (`NF`)**

AWK automatically counts the number of fields in each line with the special variable `NF`.

- **Print the number of fields in a line:**
    ```
    command → echo "one two three four" | awk '{print NF}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    4
    ```
    - This prints the number of fields (4 in this case).

- **Print the last field:**
    ```
    command → echo "one two three four" | awk '{print $NF}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    four
    ```
    - `$NF` refers to the last field.

- **Print the second-last field:**
    ```
    command → echo "one two three four" | awk '{print $(NF-1)}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    three
    ```

- **Print both the last and second-last fields:**
    ```
    command → echo "one two three four" | awk '{print $NF, $(NF-1)}'
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    four three
    ```

---


#### 9. **Working with `/etc/passwd` File Fields**

You can use `NF` to analyze the `/etc/passwd` file or other files.

- **Print the number of fields in each line of `/etc/passwd`:**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk '{print NF}'
    ```

- **Print the last field of each line in `/etc/passwd`:**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk '{print $NF}'
    ```

- **Print both the last and second-last fields in `/etc/passwd`:**
    ```
    command → cat /etc/passwd | awk '{print $NF, $(NF-1)}'
    ```

---


### Summary:
AWK is an extremely flexible tool for text processing. It allows you to:
- Access specific fields.
- Update or filter data based on conditions.
- Use mathematical operations.
- Process files with specific delimiters.
- Count fields with `NF` and manipulate data accordingly.

### **SED**

   sed OPTIONS [SCRIPT] [INPUT_FILE]

   SCRIPT:

   [addr]X[options

   X is a single-letter sed command

[addr] can be a single line number, a regular expression, or a range of lines. If [addr] is specified, the command X will be expression only on the matched lines

Additional [ options ] are used for some sed command

`sed ‘20,25d’ input.txt > output.txt`

The following example deletes lines 20 to 25 in the input.

20,25 is an address range

d is the delete commans

SED commands

   a text                                            append text adter a line
   
   d                                                 delete the pattern
   
   i text                                            insert text before a line
   
   p                                                 print the pattern space
   
   q [ exit-code ]                                   (quit) Exit sed without processing any more commands to input
   
   s/regexp/replacement/[flags]                      (subsstitute) Match the regular-expansion against the content of the pattern space. If found, replace matched string with replacement.

Command Line operations

   -n                                                disable automatic printing; sed only produces output when explicitly told to via the p command.
   
   -e script                                         add script
   
   -r                                                use extended regular expression rather than basic regular expressions.

---

```bash
sed ‘1.2p’ /etc/passwd
```

This will print line 1 and 2, two times and the rest of the file as same as it is

```bash
sed -n ‘1.2p’ /etc/passwd
```

This command will only print line 1 and 2, the rest of the file will not be printed

```bash
sed -n ‘/^$/p’ /etc/passwd
```

Print only empty lines

```bash
sed -n ‘/^$/!p’ /etc/passwd
```

Do not print empty lines

```bash
sed -n '1,$p' /etc/passwd
```

Print all lines 

```bash
sed -n '$p' /etc/passwd
```

This will only print last line

```bash
sed -n '5,8!p' /etc/passwd
```

Do not print lines 5 to 8

```bash
sed '5,$d' /etc/passwd
```

Do not print lines 5 to last / print lines 1 to 4

---

### Pattern Matching / Pattern Searching

```bash
sed -n '/root/p' /etc/passwd
```

Matching `root` in given file

```bash
sed -n '/root/,+3p' /etc/passwd
```

Print lines where `root` is matched and print next 3 lines where `root` is matched 

---

### Find and replace

```bash
sed -n 's/sbin/SBIN' /etc/passwd
```

Searching `sbin` and replacing it with `SBIN`  ( This will only replace first match in a single lines )

```bash
sed -n 's/root/ROOT/gp' /etc/passwd
```

`g` Means global, every single match of the file will be replaced with the word we are replacing 

```bash
sed -n 's/root/ROOT/1p' /etc/passwd
```

Match `root` in line in given file and replace only first `root` with`ROOT` 

```bash
sed -n 's/root/ROOT/2p' /etc/passwd
```

Match `root` in line in given file and replace only second `root` with`ROOT` 

```bash
echo “Welcome To Presidential Suite” | sed ‘s/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g’
```

Output will be :
`(W)elcome (T)o (P)residential (S)uite`

```bash
sed ‘4 s/sbin/SBIN/’ file_name.txt
```

This will replace `sbin` to `SBIN` in line number `4`

```bash
sed G file_name.txt
```

Adds an empty line after every line in the file.

```bash
sed 'G;G;G' file_name.txt
```

This will add 3 empty lines after every line in the file.

---

### Append

```bash
sed ‘/arnold/a ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` after `arnold` in the given file

```bash
sed ‘2a ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` after the second line of the given file

```bash
sed ‘5a ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` after the fifth line of the given file

```bash
sed ‘5!a ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` after every line except fifth line of the given file

```bash
sed ‘1,5a ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` after every line between 1 to 5th line of the given file 

---

### prepend

```bash
sed ‘1i ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` before the first line of the given file

```bash
sed ‘5!i ARNOLD User’ file_name.txt
```

This will add `ARNOLD User` before every line except fifth line of the given file

```bash
sed ‘1i--------------------’ filename.txt
```

This will make a line after line 1

```bash

`Arnold user UID ***`

```bash
echo “Arnold user UID 1000” | sed ‘s/[[:digit:]]/*****/’
```

This will replace only first digit with five stars ( ***** ) ; Output will be :
`Arnold user UID *****000`

```bash
echo “Arnold user UID 1000” | sed ‘s/[0-9]\+/*****/’

Using Pattern instead of Character class;Output will be :
`Arnold user UID *****`

```bash
sed ‘s/[0-9]\+/*****/g’ filename.txt
```

```bash
sed ‘s/[[:digit:]]\+/***/g’ filename.txt
```

This will replace all of the digits of the given file with three stars 

```bash

### Multiple sed commands [ -e ]

```bash
sed -ne ‘/arnold/p’ -ne ‘/root/p’ filename.txt
```

```bash
sed -e ‘/arnold/a "+++++++++++++++++++++" ’ -e ‘/arnold/i "---------------------" ’ filename.txt
```

This command will append `+++++++++++++++++++++` and prepend `---------------------` at the same time when the `arnold` word is found in the given file.

### Saving the changes [ -i ]

```bash
sed -i -e ‘/arnold/a "+++++++++++++++++++++" ’ -e ‘/arnold/i "---------------------" ’ filename.txt
```
