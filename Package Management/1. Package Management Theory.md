### **1. RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)**

**What is it?**  
RPM is the package manager used by distributions like **RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)**, **CentOS**, and **Fedora**. It helps you install, remove, and manage software packages.

- **File Format**: `.rpm`

#### **Using YUM/DNF (Frontend Tools for RPM):**

These tools make it easier to handle dependencies when installing packages, and they provide a more user-friendly experience.

- **Install a package**:  
  ```bash
  sudo yum install package-name
  ```
  Or with DNF:  
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install package-name
  ```

  sudo apt update
  ```

- **Upgrade all installed packages**:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

---

### **Differences between RPM and dpkg**

- **RPM** is used by Red Hat-based systems (like RHEL, CentOS, Fedora) and uses `.rpm` packages.
- **dpkg** is used by Debian-based systems (like Debian, Ubuntu) and uses `.deb` packages.
- Both have frontend tools (YUM/DNF for RPM and APT for dpkg) that make managing packages easier, like resolving dependencies and automating updates.

### **Example RPM Package Naming**

The naming of RPM packages can tell you a lot about them:

For example:  
`httpd-2.4.6-93.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm`

- **httpd**: The name of the package (Apache HTTP Server).
- **2.4.6**: Version of the package.
- **93**: Release number.
- **el7**: Built for Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS) version 7.
- **centos**: Specific to CentOS.
- **x86_64**: Architecture (64-bit system).
- **.rpm**: The file type for RPM packages.

---

### **Example dpkg Package Naming**

For a `.deb` package, the name might look like this:  
`nginx_1.20.1-1_amd64.deb`

- **nginx**: Package name (Nginx web server).
- **1.20.1-1**: Version and release number.
- **amd64**: Architecture (64-bit system).
- **.deb**: The file type for Debian packages.

---

### Summary:
- **RPM** is for Red Hat-based systems, and **dpkg** is for Debian-based systems.
- You can use commands like `rpm -i` or `dpkg -i` to install software.
- Tools like **YUM/DNF** (for RPM) and **APT** (for dpkg) help manage packages more easily.
