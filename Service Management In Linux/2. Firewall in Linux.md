# Firewall: Network Security Barrier

A **firewall** is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a protective barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

## Purpose
The primary function of a firewall is to allow or deny network traffic based on a set of rules.

## Key Functions of a Firewall
1. **Traffic Filtering:**
   - Examines packets and applies security rules based on IP, ports, and protocols.
   - Example: A rule may allow HTTP traffic (port 80) but block FTP traffic (port 21).
2. **Access Control:**
   - Controls who can access specific parts of a network.
   - Example: Restrict SSH access (port 22) to only internal IPs.
3. **Intrusion Prevention:**
   - Detects suspicious activity (e.g., port scanning, large data transfers).
   - Can block threats automatically before they exploit vulnerabilities.
4. **Monitoring & Logging:**
   - Keeps logs of traffic activity for auditing and forensic analysis.
   - Helps in incident response and identifying security threats.

## Types of Firewalls
Firewalls can be categorized based on how they inspect traffic and their placement in a network.

### 1. Packet-Filtering Firewalls (Stateless)
- Operate at the **network layer** (Layer 3 - OSI Model).
- Apply predefined rules to allow or block packets based on:
  - Source/Destination IP
  - Source/Destination Port
  - Protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- **Does NOT track connection states.**

**Example Rule:**
```plaintext
Allow TCP traffic from 192.168.1.100 to 10.0.0.5 on port 80.
```
**Pros:** Fast and efficient.  
**Cons:** Less secure (vulnerable to attacks like packet spoofing).

### 2. Stateful Firewalls
- Operate at the **network and transport layers** (Layer 3 & 4).
- Keep track of connection states (e.g., TCP Handshake).
- Only allow packets that belong to an established connection.

**Example:**
```plaintext
If a client sends a TCP SYN to a web server, the firewall remembers the connection and allows only valid responses.
```
**Pros:** More secure (protects against unauthorized packets).  
**Cons:** Slightly slower due to tracking connection states.

### 3. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)
- Advanced **stateful firewalls** with **deep packet inspection (DPI)**.
- Can analyze traffic at the **application layer** (Layer 7).
- Include **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), malware filtering, and VPN capabilities**.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Can detect and block malicious HTTP requests (SQL Injection, XSS).
```

## Firewalls in Linux
Firewalls in Linux can be managed using:
1. **iptables** (Legacy, for manual rule configuration)
2. **firewalld** (Used in modern distributions like CentOS/RHEL)
3. **ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)** (User-friendly, for Ubuntu/Debian)

### 1. iptables (Legacy - Can Be Both Stateless and Stateful)
- By default, **iptables** can act as a stateless firewall if only packet-filtering rules are applied.
- It can also be **stateful** when using the `-m state` or `-m conntrack` modules, allowing it to track connection states.

#### Example: Stateless iptables Rule
```bash
# Block all incoming traffic except SSH
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -P INPUT DROP  # Drop all other incoming traffic
```
**Behavior:** Stateless because it does not track connection statesâ€”it simply allows packets destined for port 22 (SSH) and drops everything else.

#### Example: Stateful iptables Rule
```bash
# Allow incoming SSH if it's part of an established connection
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -P INPUT DROP  # Drop all other traffic
```
**Behavior:**
- The first rule allows traffic **only** if it's part of an existing or related connection (stateful behavior).
- The second rule allows new SSH connections.
- The policy drops all other traffic.

### 2. firewalld (Stateful Firewall - Default in RHEL/CentOS/Fedora)
- firewalld uses **nftables** (or iptables in older versions) and is **stateful by default**.
- Tracks connections and applies dynamic rules without requiring manual updates like iptables.

#### Example: Allow SSH in firewalld (Stateful)
```bash
firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```
**Behavior:** Allows SSH traffic and tracks connection states, ensuring that established SSH sessions remain uninterrupted.

#### Example: Allow Web Traffic (HTTP and HTTPS)
```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 3. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall - Stateful by Default)
- **UFW** is a wrapper around iptables but is **stateful by default**.
- Tracks connections and allows only legitimate packets for existing sessions.

#### Example: Allow SSH in UFW (Stateful)
```bash
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw enable
```
**Behavior:** UFW automatically tracks connections for allowed ports.

#### Example: Block All Incoming Traffic Except SSH
```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow ssh
ufw enable
```
