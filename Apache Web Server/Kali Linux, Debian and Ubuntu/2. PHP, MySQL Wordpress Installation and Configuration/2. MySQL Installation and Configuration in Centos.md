### **What is MySQL?**  
MySQL is an **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)** that uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to store, manage, and retrieve data. It is maintained by **Oracle Corporation**.  

---

### **How does MySQL work?**  
1. **Stores data in tables** (rows & columns).  
2. **Uses SQL commands** to manage data:  
   - `INSERT` → Add data  
   - `SELECT` → Retrieve data  
   - `UPDATE` → Modify data  
   - `DELETE` → Remove data  
3. **Works on a client-server model** (Server stores data, Client queries data).  

---

### **Why is MySQL used?**  
✅ **Web applications & websites** (e.g., WordPress, Facebook).  
✅ **Fast & scalable** for large data sets.  
✅ **Free & open-source** with strong security.  
✅ **Reliable for data storage & management**.

# MySQL Installation and Configuration (Kali/Ubuntu/Debian)

## Download and Install MySQL APT Repository
```bash
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.29-1_all.deb
```
```bash
dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.29-1_all.deb
```
- When prompted, use arrow keys to select MySQL 8.0.
- Press `Enter` to confirm and exit.

```bash
apt update
```

## Enable and Disable MySQL Versions (If multiple versions are listed)
> *(Skip if you selected 8.0 during APT repo config)*
```bash
dpkg-reconfigure mysql-apt-config
```

## Search for MySQL Packages
```bash
apt-cache search mysql-server
```

## Install MySQL Server and Development Packages
```bash
apt install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
```

## Check MySQL Service Status
```bash
systemctl status mysql
```
```bash
systemctl enable mysql
```
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep mysql
```

## Start and Restart MySQL Service
```bash
systemctl start mysql
```
```bash
systemctl restart mysql
```
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep mysql
```

## Retrieve MySQL Root Password
```bash
grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysql/error.log
```
*(If no password is shown, root may be using auth_socket plugin. We'll reset below.)*

## Secure MySQL Installation
```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

- Set root password: `Nikhil@123`
- Answer prompts (Y/n) as needed.

## Login with New MySQL Root Password
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter password:
```
Nikhil@123
```

## Change Root Password (If Needed)
```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Nikhil@123';
```
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
EXIT;
```

Change password again:
```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Patidar@123';
```

Sample Output:
```text
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Patidar@123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
```
