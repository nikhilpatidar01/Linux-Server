### 🧾 **What is MySQL?**

MySQL is an **open-source RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System) that uses **SQL** to manage data efficiently. It’s the database backbone for many popular websites and applications.

---

### ⚙️ **How Does MySQL Work?**

* Uses **tables (rows & columns)** to store structured data.
* Operates on a **client-server model**.
* Executes commands via SQL like:

  * `SELECT` → Get data
  * `INSERT` → Add data
  * `UPDATE` → Edit data
  * `DELETE` → Remove data

---

### ✅ **Why Use MySQL?**

* ✔ Free and Open Source
* ✔ Fast and scalable
* ✔ Secure and reliable
* ✔ Widely supported by apps (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)

# 🔽 MySQL Installation & Configuration (Debian-based)

---

## 📦 Step 1: Add MySQL APT Repository

```bash
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.29-1_all.deb
dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.29-1_all.deb
apt update
```

* Use arrow keys and select **MySQL 8.0** if prompted
* Press **Enter** to confirm

---

## 🔍 Step 2: (Optional) Reconfigure APT Repo

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure mysql-apt-config
```

---

## 📚 Step 3: Search Available MySQL Packages

```bash
apt-cache search mysql-server
```

---

## 📥 Step 4: Install MySQL Server

```bash
apt install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
```

---

## 🚦 Step 5: Check MySQL Service Status

```bash
systemctl status mysql
```

Enable MySQL to start at boot:

```bash
systemctl enable mysql
```

---

## ▶️ Step 6: Start / Restart MySQL Service

```bash
systemctl start mysql
systemctl restart mysql
```

Check if MySQL is listening:

```bash
netstat -nltup | grep mysql
```

---

## 🔐 Step 7: Set/Find Root Password

If MySQL sets a temporary password, find it:

```bash
grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

If not found, root likely uses **auth\_socket** plugin — just run:

```bash
mysql -u root
```

---

## 🔧 Step 8: Secure the Installation

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

✅ Recommended responses:

* Set root password → Yes
* Remove anonymous users → Yes
* Disallow remote root login → Yes
* Remove test database → Yes
* Reload privilege tables → Yes

Example password: `Nikhil@123`

---

## 🔑 Step 9: Login with New Password

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Then enter:

```
Nikhil@123
```

---

## 🛠 Step 10: Change Root Password (If Needed)

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Patidar@123';
```

📥 Example Output:

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Patidar@123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
```

---

## 📂 Step 11: Show All Databases

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

📥 Output:

```sql
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

---

✅ You now have MySQL 8 properly installed and secured on Kali/Ubuntu/Debian.
