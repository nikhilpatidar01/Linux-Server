```

Extract the downloaded package:

## 2. Apache VirtualHost Configuration

A **VirtualHost** configuration allows Apache to serve multiple websites from the same server.

### Step 1: Open the Apache configuration file for editing:

```bash
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf
```

### Step 2: Configure VirtualHost for SSL

To enable **HTTPS** support for your website, add the following configuration in the Apache Virtual Host file:

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.55:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```

### Step 2: Configure VirtualHost for HTTP

If you want your site to be accessible over **HTTP (non-secure)**, use this configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.55:80>
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable site and necessary modules:

```bash
a2ensite wordpress.conf
a2enmod ssl
a2enmod rewrite
```

## Step 3: Restart apache2, ufw, bind9 Service 

Restart Apache to apply changes:

```bash
systemctl restart apache2
```

Restart firewall services if necessary:

```bash
systemctl restart ufw
```

Restart DNS service if applicable:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

Test domain resolution to ensure WordPress is accessible:

```bash
dig nikhil.local
```

---

### Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://nikhil.local` or `https://nikhil.local` to complete the WordPress setup.
http
```
http://192.168.112.54
http://nikhil.local
```
https
```
https://192.168.112.54
https://nikhil.local
```
