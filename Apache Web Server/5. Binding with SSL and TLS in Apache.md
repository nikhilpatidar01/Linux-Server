# Binding with SSL/TLS in Apache

## 1. Install and Configure SSL/TLS in Apache

### Step 1: Install `mod_ssl`
`mod_ssl` is an Apache module that provides SSL and TLS support.

```apache
yum install mod_ssl
```

### Step 2: Verify `mod_ssl` Installation
Check if the module is installed:

```
rpm -qi mod_ssl
```

```
rpm -ql mod_ssl
```

```
rpm -qd mod_ssl
```

### Step 3: Configure SSL in Apache
Edit the SSL configuration file:

```apache
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
Ensure that SSL is enabled by setting appropriate certificate files:

```apache
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
```
```apache
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
```

### Step 4: Restart Apache
Restart Apache to apply SSL configuration:

```apache
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

### Step 5: Verify Apache Listening on SSL Port
Check if Apache is listening on port 443 (SSL):

```apache
netstat -nltup | grep httpd
```

### Step 6: Update Firewall for SSL
Edit the firewall rules to allow SSL traffic (port 443):

```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
```
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
```
```apache

firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 2. Create Self-Signed SSL Certificates

### Step 1: Create SSL Directory
Create a directory to store SSL certificates:

```
mkdir /opt/ssl
```
```
cd /opt/ssl
```

### Step 2: Generate SSL Certificate and Key
Generate a self-signed SSL certificate and key:

```apache
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

### Step 3: Check the Generated Files
Verify the files:

```
ls -lh
```
```
file key.pem
```
```
file cert.pem
```

### Step 4: Copy SSL Files to Appropriate Directories
Copy the certificate and key to the proper directories:

```
cp -v /opt/ssl/cert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem
```
```
cp -v /opt/ssl/key.pem /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
```

---

## 3. Update Apache Configuration with SSL Certificates
Edit the Apache configuration to point to the newly created certificates:

```apache
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
Modify or add these lines:

```apache
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem
```
```apache
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
```
Main File Configuration:
```apache
#   Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
#   the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
#   pass phrase.  Note that restarting httpd will prompt again.  Keep
#   in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you
#   can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA
#   ciphers, etc.)
#   Some ECC cipher suites (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4492.txt)
#   require an ECC certificate which can also be configured in
#   parallel.
#SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem

#   Server Private Key:
#   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
#   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
#   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
#   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
#   ECC keys, when in use, can also be configured in parallel
#SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
```

Restart Apache again:

```apache
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

---

## 4. Verify SSL Binding in Apache
Check if Apache is listening on both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443):

```apache
netstat -nltup | grep httpd
```

---

## 5. Update Firewall for SSL/TLS Ports
Ensure that port 443 is open in your firewall configuration:

```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 6. Configure Apache Virtual Hosts with SSL/TLS
You can create Virtual Hosts with SSL/TLS enabled.

### Open Configuration File

```apache
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### Example of Apache Virtual Hosts for HTTP and HTTPS

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.112:80>
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site2/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site2/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```

---

## 7. Advanced Configuration with Custom CA (Certificate Authority)
If you want to use a self-generated Certificate Authority (CA):

Remove old file in genrate folder */opt/ssl*
```
cd /opt/ssl/
```
delete File all.
```
 rm -rf cert.pem key.pem
```
### Step 1: Generate the Private Key for the CA

```apache
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
```

### Step 2: Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

```apache
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
```

### Step 3: Create the Self-Signed Certificate for the CA

```apache
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
```

### Step 4: Copy the CA Certificate and Key to the Appropriate Directories

```apache
cp -v /opt/ssl/ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
```
```apache
cp -v /opt/ssl/ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
```


### 5. Configure Apache Virtual Hosts with SSL/TLS
You can create Virtual Hosts with SSL/TLS enabled.

### Open Configuration File

```apache
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### Example of Apache Virtual Hosts for HTTP and HTTPS

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.112:80>
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site2/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site2/
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```
Restart Apache again:

```apache
systemctl restart httpd.service
```
```apache
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
Modify or Remove old Certificate these lines:

Default Add
```apache
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
```
Default Add
```apache
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
```
Main File Configuration:
```apache
#   Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
#   the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
#   pass phrase.  Note that restarting httpd will prompt again.  Keep
#   in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you
#   can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA
#   ciphers, etc.)
#   Some ECC cipher suites (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4492.txt)
#   require an ECC certificate which can also be configured in
#   parallel.
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt

#   Server Private Key:
#   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
#   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
#   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
#   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
#   ECC keys, when in use, can also be configured in parallel
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
```

Restart Apache again:

```apache
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

## 8. Final Steps
After configuring your Virtual Hosts and SSL certificates, restart Apache and check the ports once again:

```
systemctl restart httpd.service
```
```
netstat -nltup | grep httpd
```

Test your websites using both HTTP and HTTPS URLs:

| Domain             | Port | Expected Output                 |
|-------------------|------|--------------------------------|
| http://nikhil.local | 80   | Site1 homepage                 |
| https://nikhil.local | 443  | Site1 (SSL-enabled) homepage  |
