# CGI Scripts (Common Gateway Interface)

**CGI (Common Gateway Interface)** is a standard protocol used to run external programs or scripts on a web server to generate dynamic web content. These scripts can be written in various languages like **Python, Perl, PHP**, or **Shell**, and are commonly used to deliver dynamic content based on user input.

---

## How CGI Works

### Client Request

A user accesses a CGI-enabled URL by clicking a link or submitting a form.


### Server Execution

The web server runs the CGI script located in the `cgi-bin` directory.


### Dynamic Response

The script processes any input and sends a dynamically generated HTML response to the client.

## Supported Technologies

- **Perl** – Historically common for web scripting.
- **Python** – Readable and easy to maintain.
- **PHP** – Widely used for web development (though not strictly CGI).
- **Ruby** – Flexible and dynamic.
- **Shell Scripts** – Useful for small utilities and server-side tasks.

## Installation and Configuration Steps

### Install Apache
```bash
yum install httpd*
```

### Install Perl CGI Module
```bash
yum install perl-CGI
```

### Install Perl
```bash
yum install perl
```

### Verify CGI Module is Enabled in Apache
```bash
httpd -M
```

### Filter CGI Module from Apache Modules
```bash
httpd -M | grep cgi
```

### Check SELinux Status 
must be disable 
```bash
sestatus
```

---

## Apache Configuration

### Edit Apache Configuration
```bash
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### CGI Script Directory Block
Find the line CGI and Add some data
```apache
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py .sh
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

## Creating and Deploying CGI Scripts

### Create a Simple CGI Script (Perl)
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/test.cgi
```

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<h1>Server Memory Usage"
print "<pre>";
exec("free -h");
print "</pre>";
```

### Set Ownership
```bash
chown apache:apache /var/www/cgi-bin/test.cgi
```

### Set Permissions
```bash
chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/test.cgi
```

### Restart Apache
```bash
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

### Browse in Browser
```
http://192.168.129.146/cgi-bin/test.cgi
```

---

## Additional CGI Scripts

### Create `mem.cgi`
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/mem.cgi
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo
echo "<h1>Server Memory Usage </h2>
echo "<pre>"
free -h
echo "</pre>"
```

#### Set Ownership and Permissions
```bash
chown apache:apache /var/www/cgi-bin/mem.cgi
chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/mem.cgi
```

---

### Create `ping.cgi`
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/ping.cgi
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo
echo "Ping the Server:"
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

#### Set Ownership and Permissions
```bash
chown apache:apache /var/www/cgi-bin/ping.cgi
chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/ping.cgi
```

#### Access in Browser
```
http://192.168.129.146/cgi-bin/ping.cgi
```

---

## Other Sample Scripts

### Create `script.cgi`
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/script.cgi
chmod +x /var/www/cgi-bin/script.cgi
ls -lh /var/www/cgi-bin/script.cgi
```

---

### Create `script2.cgi`
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/script2.cgi
chmod +x /var/www/cgi-bin/script2.cgi
ls -lh /var/www/cgi-bin/script2.cgi
```

---

## Python Script Example – `hello1.cgi`

### Create Script
```bash
nano /var/www/cgi-bin/hello1.cgi
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Content-type: text/html\n")
print("<h1>Hello, CGI</h1>")
```

### Make Executable
```bash
chmod +x /var/www/cgi-bin/hello1.cgi
```

### List Script
```bash
ls -lh /var/www/cgi-bin/hello1.cgi
```

### Browse in Browser
```
http://192.168.129.146/cgi-bin/hello1.cgi
```

---

## Securing the `cgi-bin` Directory

### Restrict Access to Authenticated Users

To enhance security, limit access to CGI scripts to authenticated users only.

### Step 1: Edit Apache Configuration
```bash
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### Step 2: Add or Modify Directory Block
```apache
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .py .sh
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Nikhil CGI"
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/htpasswd
    Require valid-user
</Directory>
```

### Step 3: Create the Authentication File

#### First User:
```bash
htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/htpasswd username
```

#### Additional Users:
```bash
htpasswd /etc/httpd/htpasswd anotheruser
```

### Step 4: Restart Apache
```bash
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

### Access in Browser
```
http://192.168.129.146/cgi-bin/hello1.cgi
```

#### Enter Username and Password
```
Username: Nikhil
Password: 123
```
