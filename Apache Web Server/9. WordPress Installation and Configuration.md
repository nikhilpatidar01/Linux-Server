# WordPress Installation and Configuration

WordPress is a popular **Content Management System (CMS)** used to create and manage websites.

## Step 1: Download and Extract WordPress

Download the latest version of WordPress from the official website:

```bash
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
```

Extract the downloaded package:

```bash
unzip latest.zip
```

Move WordPress files to the Apache web directory:

```bash
cp -vr wordpress/ /var/www/html/
```

Navigate to the web root directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
```

Set the correct ownership to allow Apache to manage WordPress files:

```bash
chown -Rv apache:apache wordpress/
```

Navigate to the WordPress directory:

```bash
cd wordpress/
```

Set proper permissions for essential WordPress directories:

```bash
chmod -Rv 0755 wp-includes/ wp-admin/js/ wp-content/themes/ wp-content/plugins/
```

## 2. Apache VirtualHost Configuration

A **VirtualHost** configuration allows Apache to serve multiple websites from the same server.
### Step 1: Open the Apache configuration file for editing:

```bash
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### Step 2: Configure VirtualHost for SSL

To enable **HTTPS** support for your website, add the following configuration in the Apache Virtual Host file:

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```

### Step 2: Configure VirtualHost for HTTP

If you want your site to be accessible over **HTTP (non-secure)**, use this configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost 192.168.112.145:80>
    ServerName nikhil.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    ServerAlias www.nikhil.local
</VirtualHost>
```

## Step 3: Restart httpd Service 

Restart Apache to apply changes:

```bash
systemctl restart httpd
```

Restart firewall services if necessary:

```bash
systemctl restart firewalld
```

Restart DNS service if applicable:

```bash
systemctl restart named
```

Test domain resolution to ensure WordPress is accessible:

```bash
dig nikhil.local
```

---

### Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://nikhil.local` or `https://nikhil.local` to complete the WordPress setup.
http
```
http://nikhil.local
```
https
```
https://nikhil.local
```
