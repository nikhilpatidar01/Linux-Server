# **Network File System (NFS) Setup**

## **Introduction**
A **Network File System (NFS) Server** allows users to access, share, and manage files over a network as if they were stored locally. Developed by **Sun Microsystems** in 1984, NFS is widely used in UNIX, Linux, and Windows environments.

---

## **What is NFS Server?**
An **NFS server** is a machine that provides file access to multiple clients using the **NFS protocol**. This enables seamless file sharing and centralized storage management.

### **How NFS Works**
1. The **NFS Server** exports directories for sharing.  
2. The **NFS Client** mounts these directories over the network.  
3. Clients access and manipulate files as if stored locally.  
4. Any changes made by one client are visible to all others in real time.

### **Key Features**
- Remote File Access  
- Centralized Storage  
- Multi-User Access  
- Security and Authentication  
- Scalability  
- Performance Optimization with Caching

## **Advantages of NFS**
✔ **Cost-Effective** – No additional software required.  
✔ **Seamless Integration** – Works with Linux, UNIX, and Windows.  
✔ **Easy to Configure** – Simple setup and management.  
✔ **Efficient File Sharing** – Reduces redundancy and improves collaboration.  

---

## **Disadvantages of NFS**
✖ **Security Risks** – Improper configuration can expose sensitive data.  
✖ **Performance Issues** – Can be slow over busy networks.  
✖ **Reliability** – If the NFS server goes down, all clients lose access.

## **1. Install NFS Packages**

### **Check if NFS packages are installed:**
```bash
rpm -qa | grep nfs
```

### **Install NFS packages:**
```bash
yum install nfs-utils
```
### **Install rpcbind (required for NFS):**
```bash
yum install rpcbind
```


### **Check information about the NFS package:**
```bash
rpm -qi nfs-utils
```

### **List files installed by nfs-utils:**
```bash
rpm -ql nfs-utils
```

### **List documentation for nfs-utils:**
```bash
rpm -qd nfs-utils
```

### **List configuration files for nfs-utils:**
```bash
rpm -qc nfs-utils
```


### **2. Enable and start NFS services:**

Enable Services to Start on Boot.
```bash
systemctl enable rpcbind
```
```bash
systemctl enable nfs-server
```
```bash
systemctl enable nfs-lock
```
```bash
systemctl enable nfs-idmap
```

Start Services Now.

```bash
systemctl start rpcbind
```
```bash
systemctl start nfs-server
```

```bash
systemctl start nfs-lock
```

```bash
systemctl start nfs-idmap
```




### **3. Create a directory for sharing (e.g., /data):**
```bash
mkdir -p /data
```

### **Set permissions to allow full access (read, write, execute):**
```bash
chmod 777 /data
```

### **4. Configure NFS exports:**
Edit the /etc/exports file.
```bash
vim /etc/exports
```

#### **Example `/etc/exports` configuration:**
```apache
#Allow read-write with sync
/data/ *(rw,sync)

# Read-only access
# /data/ 192.168.1.0/24(ro.sync)

# Alloe root privileges (use with cautiion)
#/data/ 192.168.1.0/24(rw, sync, no_root_squash, no_all_squash)
```

#### **Explanation of options:**
- **/data**: Shared directory  
- **192.168.1.0/24**: Network range of clients that can access the shared directory  
- **rw**: Read-write permission  
- **sync**: Synchronous writes for better data integrity  
- **no_root_squash** *(optional)*: Allows root on the client to have root access on the server  
- **no_all_squash** *(optional)*: Keeps client users' UID and GID intact  

### **Export the directory to clients:**
```bash
exportfs -rav
```
Optional: Verify Exports.
```bash
exportfs -v
```

### **Restart NFS server to apply changes:**
```bash
systemctl restart nfs-server
```

### **5. Open NFS Ports in Firewalld**
Enable and Start Firewalld
```apache
systemctl enable firewalld
```
```apache
systemctl start firewalld
```

Allow NFS-related ports (20048, 2049, 111) in the firewall
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2049/tcp
```
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=111/tcp
```
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=20048/tcp
```

Add NFS Services to firewalld permanently
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
```
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd
```
```apache
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind
```

## **Reload firewalld to apply the changes:**
```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Optional Verify open ports.
```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

## **6. NFS Client Setup**

### **Install required packages on the client machine:**
```bash
yum install rpcbind nfs-utils
```
```bash
yum install showmount
```

### Notes:-
- rw - Writable access
- ro - Read Only
- sync - Ensures data is written to disk before responding
- no_root_squach - Allows root access on client (insecure in prod)
- no_all_squash - Preserves UID/GID from client
---

### **Check the shared directories on the NFS server:**

Check the status of the NFS Server.
```bashsy
systemctl status nfs-server
```

View system log entries for errors.
```bash
journalctl -xe
```
Check visibility of exports from the client.
```bash
showmount -e 192.168.1.10
```


### **Create a mount point on the client:**
```bash
mkdir /mnt/d1
```

### **Mount the NFS share:**
```bash
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.10:/data /mnt/d1/
```

### **Verify the mount:**
```bash
df -h  # Check if the NFS share is mounted successfully
```

### **Make the mount persistent by editing `/etc/fstab`:**
```bash
vim /etc/fstab
```

#### **Add the following line to the file:**
```
192.168.1.10:/data  /mnt/d1  nfs  rw,sync,hard,intr  0  0
```

### **To apply changes in `/etc/fstab`:**
```bash
mount -a
```
