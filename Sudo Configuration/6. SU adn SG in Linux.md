# 🚀 Switching Users and Groups in Linux

## 1️⃣ `su` Command (Switch User)

The `su` (**substitute user**) command allows a user to **switch to another user account** or execute commands as another user, commonly `root`.

### 🔹 **Key Features**
✔ Requires authentication using the **password of the target user**.  
✔ Enables complete user switching or execution of commands under a different user.  
✔ `su` → Switches user without changing environment variables.  
✔ `su -` → Starts a new shell session with the full login environment of the target user.  

### 📌 **Syntax**
```bash
su [OPTIONS] [USERNAME]
```

### ⚙️ **Commonly Used Options**
- `-` → Loads the target user’s environment variables.
- `-c "command"` → Executes a single command as the target user.
- `-s /bin/bash` → Changes the shell when switching users.

### 📖 **Examples**
🔹 **Switch to the `root` user**  
```bash
su
```
This prompts for the `root` user password.

🔹 **Switch to a specific user (e.g., `john`)**  
```bash
su john
```
This switches to `john`’s account and requires authentication.

🔹 **Run a command as another user**  
```bash
su -c "whoami" username
```
Example:  
```bash
su -c "ls /root" root
```
Runs `ls /root` as `root` while staying in the current shell.

🔹 **Start a full login session for a user**  
```bash
su - username
```
Loads the user’s full environment as if they had logged in directly.

## 2️⃣ `sg` Command (Switch Group)

The `sg` (**substitute group**) command allows users to **execute commands as a member of a specified group**.  
This is useful when working with **group-based permissions** without changing user ownership.

### 🔹 **Key Features**
✔ Runs commands under a **specific group context**.  
✔ No password authentication required.  
✔ The user must already be a member of the target group.  
✔ Only executes commands, does not open a full session.  

### 📌 **Syntax**
```bash
sg groupname -c "command"
```

### 📖 **Examples**
🔹 **Run a command as a member of a group**  
```bash
sg developers -c "touch file.txt"
```
Creates a file under the `developers` group context.

🔹 **Start a new shell as a member of a group**  
```bash
sg groupname
```
Opens a shell where commands execute under the specified group.

🔹 **Check your current group membership**  
```bash
groups
```
Displays all groups you belong to.

## 3️⃣ 🔄 `su` vs. `sg` Comparison Table

| Feature            | 🧑‍💻 `su` (Switch User)                 | 📂 `sg` (Switch Group)                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Switch to another **user account**.  | Temporarily switch to another **group**.  |
| **Authentication** | Requires the **target user’s password**. | Requires **membership** in the target group (no password needed). |
| **Scope**         | Switch user entirely or run commands as them. | Execute commands as a specific group member. |
| **Use Case**      | For administrative tasks or user switching. | For group-based permissions and tasks. |

## 4️⃣ 🎯 When to Use `sg`
🔹 Use `sg` when you need to **work on files** or **execute commands** with **specific group-based permissions**.  

### 📌 **Example Scenario**
- You are part of the `developers` and `admins` groups.
- A file is owned by the `admins` group.
- Instead of switching users, you can use:
  ```bash
  sg admins -c "nano file.txt"
  ```
  This allows you to edit the file **without changing ownership**.

## ✅ Summary
- **🧑‍💻 `su`** → Switch user accounts or run commands as another user.  
- **📂 `sg`** → Execute commands under a different group context.  
- **🔄 Use `su` for full user switching and `sg` for group-based tasks.**
