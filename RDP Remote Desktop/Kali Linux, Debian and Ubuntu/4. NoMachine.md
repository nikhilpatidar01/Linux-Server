## 📥 Step 1: Download and Install NoMachine

```bash
wget https://download.nomachine.com/download/8.16/Linux/nomachine_8.16.1_1_amd64.deb
```

```bash
dpkg -i nomachine_8.16.1_1_amd64.deb
```

If you face dependency issues:

```bash
apt-get install -f
```

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Check if NoMachine is Listening on Port 4000

```bash
netstat -nltup | grep 4000
```

*This verifies that NoMachine is running and listening.*

---

## 🔓 Step 3: Open Port 4000 with UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

Enable UFW if it's not already enabled:

```bash
ufw enable
```

Allow port 4000 for TCP:

```bash
ufw allow 4000/tcp
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Port is Open

```bash
ufw status
```

You should see:

```
4000/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
```

---

## 🔐 Optional: Allow Port 4000 Only for a Specific IP

To allow access only from a trusted IP (e.g., `192.168.32.150`):

```bash
ufw allow from 192.168.32.150 to any port 4000 proto tcp
```

You can verify:

```bash
ufw status
```
