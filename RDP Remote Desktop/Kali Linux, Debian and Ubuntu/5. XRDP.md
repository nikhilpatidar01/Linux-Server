## What is XRDP
XRDP is an open-source Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server for Linux systems. It allows users to access a Linux desktop environment remotely using Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Client (RDP), typically from a Windows machine or any RDP-compatible client.

---

## 🔄 Updating Package Index

Update the system's package lists to ensure the latest package versions:

```bash
apt update
```

* Ensures you have the latest available versions of packages and dependencies.

---

## 📦 Installing XRDP

apt install xrdp
```

* Downloads and installs the XRDP server for remote desktop access.

---

## 🔁 Enabling XRDP Service at Boot

Enable XRDP to start automatically at system boot:

```bash
systemctl enable xrdp
```

---

## ▶️ Starting and Restarting XRDP Services

Restart XRDP service:

```bash
systemctl restart xrdp
```

Restart `xrdp-sesman` service:

```bash
systemctl restart xrdp-sesman
```

* `xrdp-sesman` manages user sessions for XRDP.

---

## 📡 Verifying Listening Ports

Check if XRDP is listening on TCP port 3389:

```bash
netstat -nltup
```

* Look for `xrdp` entries on port `3389`.

---

## 🛠️ Manually Starting XRDP Services (Alternative Method)

If `systemctl` is not preferred, use the traditional `service` command:

```bash
service xrdp start
service xrdp-sesman start
```

---

## 🚀 Enabling XRDP at Startup (Alternative Method)

Enable XRDP at boot using `update-rc.d`:

```bash
update-rc.d xrdp enable
```

* Useful for older systems or when `systemctl` is unavailable.

---

## 🔍 Checking XRDP Service Status

Verify that the XRDP service is running:

```bash
service xrdp status
```

---

### 🌐 Connecting to the XRDP Server

Connect from a client machine:

```bash
rdesktop 192.168.12.145
```

🔁 *Replace **192.168.12.145** with your server's IP address.*

🪟 *Alternatively, you can use **Windows Remote Desktop (mstsc)**.*


---

## 📝 Additional Notes

* ✅ Ensure a desktop environment (like **XFCE**, **MATE**, etc.) is installed for GUI access.
* 🔥 Kali Linux may block RDP connections by default — ensure firewall ports (3389/tcp) are open.
* 🪵 For troubleshooting, check the following logs:

  * `/var/log/xrdp-sesman.log`
  * `/var/log/xrdp.log`
