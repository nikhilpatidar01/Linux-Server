# 🔄 **RAID Levels ** 🔄  

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a **data storage virtualization** technology that combines multiple physical drives for **redundancy, performance, or both**. Below are different **RAID levels with real-world examples**.  

---

## **1️⃣ RAID 0 (Striping) – 🚀 High Speed, No Redundancy**  
✅ **How it Works:**  
- Data is **split (striped)** across multiple disks.  
- No parity or mirroring—**if one disk fails, all data is lost**.  
- **Improves performance** but provides no fault tolerance.  

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **video editing workstation** using **2 SSDs** in RAID 0 to increase read/write speeds.  
- **Example setup:** 2 × 1TB drives → **2TB total storage** (no redundancy).  

---

## **2️⃣ RAID 1 (Mirroring) – 🛡️ Full Redundancy**  
✅ **How it Works:**  
- Data is **duplicated (mirrored)** across two disks.  
- If one disk fails, data remains safe on the second.  
- Improves **read speed**, but **write speed remains the same**.  

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **banking server** with two **4TB HDDs in RAID 1** for data safety.  
- **Example setup:** 2 × 4TB drives → **4TB usable storage** (full redundancy).  

---

## **3️⃣ RAID 5 (Striping with Parity) – ⚖️ Balance of Performance & Redundancy**  
✅ **How it Works:**  
- Data is **striped across multiple disks with parity** (error-checking information).  
- **Can survive 1 disk failure** (data is rebuilt using parity).  
- **Good balance** of speed, storage, and fault tolerance.  

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **corporate file server** with **4 × 2TB HDDs in RAID 5**.  
- **Example setup:** 4 × 2TB drives → **6TB usable storage** (one drive used for parity).  

---

## **4️⃣ RAID 6 (Striping with Dual Parity) – 🏆 Extra Fault Tolerance**  
✅ **How it Works:**  
- Like RAID 5 but with **two parity blocks**, allowing **two disk failures**.  
- **Ideal for large-scale storage solutions**.  
- Slower writes due to extra parity calculations.  

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **data center using 6 × 4TB drives in RAID 6** for critical storage.  
- **Example setup:** 6 × 4TB drives → **16TB usable storage** (two drives used for parity).  

---

## **5️⃣ RAID 10 (RAID 1 + RAID 0) – 🔥 Best of Both Worlds**  
✅ **How it Works:**  
- **Combines mirroring (RAID 1) and striping (RAID 0)**.  
- **At least 4 drives needed** (data is mirrored and striped).  
- **Fast performance & redundancy** but uses more storage.  

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **gaming or database server** with **4 × 2TB SSDs in RAID 10** for speed and reliability.  
- **Example setup:** 4 × 2TB drives → **4TB usable storage** (50% used for mirroring).

### **📝 RAID Level Comparison Table**
| RAID Level | Redundancy | Performance | Minimum Disks | Failure Tolerance | Use Case |
|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| **RAID 0** | ❌ No | 🚀 Very High | 2+ | 0 disks | Speed-focused (Gaming, Video Editing) |
| **RAID 1** | ✅ Yes | ⏫ Improved Read, Normal Write | 2 | 1 disk | Data Safety (Banking, Web Servers) |
| **RAID 5** | ✅ Yes | ⏩ Good | 3+ | 1 disk | File Servers, Medium Businesses |
| **RAID 6** | ✅ Yes | ⏳ Slower Write | 4+ | 2 disks | Large Storage (Data Centers, Cloud) |
| **RAID 10** | ✅ Yes | 🚀 High | 4+ | 1+ disks (depends on pairs) | Databases, High-Speed Applications |
