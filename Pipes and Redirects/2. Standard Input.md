# Standard Input (stdin) in Linux

## Introduction
In Linux, **Standard Input (stdin)** is one of the three standard I/O (Input/Output) streams used for communication between processes and users. It allows users to provide input to commands and programs.

- **stdin (Standard Input):** Input stream (default: keyboard)
- **stdout (Standard Output):** Output stream (default: terminal)
- **stderr (Standard Error):** Error message stream (default: terminal)

By default, **stdin** reads input from the keyboard, but it can be redirected from a file or another command.

---

## 1. Using `stdin` with Commands
Most Linux commands accept input from `stdin`. The default input source is the **keyboard**, but it can also be redirected.

### Example 1: Using `cat` to Read from stdin
```bash
$ cat
Hello, this is a test!
(Press Ctrl + D to end input)
```

### Example 2: Using `wc` to Count Words in stdin
```bash
$ wc -w
This is a Linux tutorial  # Type this and press Enter
(Press Ctrl + D to end input)
4                         # Output (word count)
```

## 2. Redirecting stdin from a File (`<` Operator)
Instead of manually typing input, you can use **input redirection (`<`)** to read from a file.

### Example: Reading from a File
```bash
$ cat < sample.txt
```
This command reads **`sample.txt`** and prints its content to the screen.

Another example with `wc`:
```bash
$ wc -l < sample.txt
```
This counts the number of lines in `sample.txt`.

## 3. Using stdin with `read` Command
The `read` command is used to take input from `stdin` and store it in a variable.

### Example: Taking User Input
```bash
$ read name
$ echo "Hello, $name!"
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, [your input]!
```

Using `read` with input redirection:
```bash
$ read var < sample.txt
$ echo $var
```
This stores the first line of `sample.txt` into `var`.

---

## 4. Using stdin with `here document` (`<<` Operator)
A **here document (`<<`)** allows multi-line input to be provided directly within a script or command.

### Example: Using `cat` with Here Document
```bash
$ cat << EOF
This is a test
Multi-line input using Here Document
EOF
```

This will print:
```
This is a test
Multi-line input using Here Document
```

---

## 5. Using stdin with Pipes (`|`)
Pipes (`|`) allow chaining commands together by passing `stdout` of one command as `stdin` to another.

### Example: Using `ls` and `wc`
```bash
$ ls | wc -l
```
This counts the number of files and directories in the current folder.

### Example: Filtering Input with `grep`
```bash
$ cat sample.txt | grep "Linux"
```
This prints lines containing the word "Linux" from `sample.txt`.

## Summary
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `stdin` | Default input stream (keyboard) |
| `<` | Redirects input from a file |
| `read` | Reads input into a variable |
| `<<` | Here Document for multi-line input |
| `|` | Pipe to pass output as input to another command |

`stdin` is a fundamental concept in Linux, used for providing input to commands efficiently. By understanding and using redirections and pipes, you can handle inputs in a powerful way.
