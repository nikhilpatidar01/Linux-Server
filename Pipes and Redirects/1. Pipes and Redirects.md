# Pipe (`|`) and Redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`) in Linux

## 1. **Pipe (`|`) in Linux**

The **pipe (`|`)** operator is used to send the output of one command as input to another command. It helps in chaining multiple commands together.

### **Example 1: Using `ls` and `wc -l`**
```bash
$ ls | wc -l
```
This command lists all files and directories and then counts the number of lines (i.e., the number of files and directories).

### **Example 2: Filtering Processes Using `ps` and `grep`**
```bash
$ ps aux | grep firefox
```
This command finds all running processes and filters only those related to **Firefox**.

## 2. **Redirection Operators in Linux**

Redirection operators are used to **redirect input and output** of commands.

### **`>` (Output Redirection – Overwrite)**
Redirects command output to a file, replacing any existing content.

#### **Example: Save `ls` Output to a File**
```bash
$ ls > filelist.txt
```
This command saves the list of files in **filelist.txt**, replacing any previous content.

---

### **`>>` (Output Redirection – Append)**
Redirects output to a file **without overwriting** the existing content.

#### **Example: Append `ls` Output to a File**
```bash
$ ls >> filelist.txt
```
This command adds the output of `ls` to **filelist.txt** without deleting previous content.

---

### **`<` (Input Redirection)**
Takes input from a file instead of the keyboard.

#### **Example: Counting Words in a File**
```bash
$ wc -l < filelist.txt
```
This command counts the number of lines in **filelist.txt**.

---

### **`2>` (Redirecting Error Output)**
Redirects **error messages** to a file.

#### **Example: Redirecting Errors to a File**
```bash
$ ls /nonexistentfolder 2> error.log
```
If the folder does not exist, the error message is saved in **error.log**.

---

### **`2>>` (Appending Error Output)**
Appends error messages to an existing file.

#### **Example: Appending Errors to a File**
```bash
$ ls /invalidfolder 2>> error.log
```
This command appends any error messages to **error.log**.

---

### **`&>` (Redirecting Both Output and Errors)**
Redirects both **standard output and standard error** to a file.

#### **Example: Save Output and Errors Together**
```bash
$ ls /home /invalidfolder &> output.log
```
This command saves both **successful output** and **error messages** in **output.log**.

---

### **`tee` Command (Display and Save Output)**
The `tee` command is used to **display output on the screen and save it to a file simultaneously**.

#### **Example: Save `ls` Output to a File and Display it**
```bash
$ ls | tee filelist.txt
```
This command shows the output of `ls` and saves it to **filelist.txt**.

---

### **Combining Pipes and Redirection**
You can use **pipes (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `>>`) together** for advanced operations.

#### **Example: Save Only `.txt` Files List to a File**
```bash
$ ls | grep ".txt" > textfiles.txt
```
This command filters `.txt` files and saves them to **textfiles.txt**.

---

### **Example: Sorting a File and Saving Output**
```bash
$ cat names.txt | sort > sorted_names.txt
```
This command sorts the contents of **names.txt** and saves the sorted output to **sorted_names.txt**.
