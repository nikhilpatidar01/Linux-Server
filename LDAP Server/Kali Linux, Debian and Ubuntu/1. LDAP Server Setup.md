# Step-by-Step Guide for Configuring LDAP on a Debian-Based Linux Server and Client

This guide includes setup instructions for LDAP along with DNS, SSH, and FTP access for LDAP user home directory login.
---

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is an open, vendor-neutral protocol used to access and manage directory information over a network. A directory in this context is a hierarchical database optimized for reading, searching, and managing information about users, groups, systems, and resources.

---

## 📌 Preliminary Steps

Before starting the configuration, update the hostname:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname ns.server.local
reboot
````

> ⚠️ You can change the domain according to your requirements.

* **Domain used:** `server.local`
* **LDAP Server IP:** `192.168.169.130`
* **LDAP Client IP:** `192.168.169.145`

> 💡 It is preferred to use **static IP addresses** for both client and server.

## 1. Configuration of DNS

We will configure the DNS server to create records for the LDAP domain. This will be used when connecting from the client to the LDAP server.

---

### 🔧 Step 1 — Install DNS Required Packages

```bash
apt install bind9 dnsutils
```

---

### 🔧 Step 2 — Create Zone in `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`

```bash
vim /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

This creates a DNS zone for `server.local`, which will be used to store DNS records for the domain.

---

### 🔧 Step 3 — Create Forward Zone Records

```bash
mkdir /etc/bind/zones
vim /etc/bind/zones/forward.server.local
```

Create the records for LDAP inside `forward.server.local`.

---

### 🔧 Step 4 — (Optional) Update `/etc/hosts`

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
```

Add your desired entries if necessary (optional step).

---

### 🔧 Step 5 — Restart DNS Services

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
systemctl enable named.service
```

---

### 🔧 Step 6 — Verify Domain Resolution

```bash
nslookup server.local 192.168.169.130
nslookup ldap.server.local 192.168.169.130
```

✅ **Expected Output:**

```bash
root@ns# nslookup server.local 192.168.169.130
Server:         192.168.169.130
Address:        192.168.169.130#53

Name:   server.local
Address: 192.168.169.130

root@ns# nslookup ldap.server.local 192.168.169.130
Server:         192.168.169.130
Address:        192.168.169.130#53

Name:   ldap.server.local
Address: 192.168.169.130
```

---

### 🛠️ Optional: Update `/etc/resolv.conf`

```bash
vim /etc/resolv.conf
```

```bash
nameserver 192.168.169.135  # add this line
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

---

✅ **All Done with DNS**. Now we are ready for LDAP configuration.
