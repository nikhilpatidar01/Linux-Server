### **What is a DHCP Server?**  

A **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server** is a network server that **automatically assigns IP addresses** and other network settings (such as subnet mask, gateway, and DNS) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration on client devices.  

---

### **How DHCP Works?**  
When a device (client) connects to a network, it follows these steps to obtain an IP address from the **DHCP server**:  

1. **DHCP Discovery** (`DHCPDISCOVER`) – The client sends a broadcast request to find a DHCP server.  
2. **DHCP Offer** (`DHCPOFFER`) – The DHCP server responds with an available IP address and network settings.  
3. **DHCP Request** (`DHCPREQUEST`) – The client requests the offered IP address.  
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment** (`DHCPACK`) – The DHCP server confirms the assignment, and the client starts using the IP address.  

---

### **Key Features of DHCP Server**  
- **Automatic IP Assignment** – Reduces manual IP configuration.  
- **Prevents IP Conflicts** – Ensures each device gets a unique IP.  
- **Centralized Network Management** – Admins can control IP address distribution from a single server.  
- **IP Lease Management** – Assigns temporary IPs, reclaiming unused ones.  
- **Supports Reserved (Static) IPs** – Assigns permanent IPs to specific devices based on their MAC address.

### **Where is DHCP Used?**  
- **Home Networks** – Routers use DHCP to assign IPs to connected devices.  
- **Enterprise Networks** – Manages thousands of devices efficiently.  
- **ISP Networks** – Assigns public IPs dynamically to customer devices.

# **DHCP Server Configuration Guide**  
This document provides a step-by-step guide to install, configure, and manage a DHCP server on a **Linux (CentOS)** system.

---

## **1. Check Available Repositories**  
List all available repositories to ensure that the DHCP server package is available:  
```bash
yum repolist all
```

---

## **2. Verify if DHCP Package is Installed**  
Check if the DHCP package is already installed:  
```bash
rpm -qa | grep dhcp
```

---

## **3. Install DHCP Server**  
Install the DHCP server package:  
```bash
yum install dhcp-server -y
```

---

## **4. Verify Installation**  
Check if the DHCP package and DHCP server are installed:  
```bash
rpm -qa | grep dhcp
rpm -qa | grep dhcp-server
```

---

## **5. Get Detailed Information About DHCP Server**  
Display detailed information about the installed DHCP server package:  
```bash
rpm -qi dhcp-server
```

---

## **6. List Documentation Files for DHCP Server**  
List the documentation files included with the DHCP server:  
```bash
rpm -qd dhcp-server
```

---

## **7. List Configuration Files for DHCP Server**  
List the configuration files included with the DHCP server:  
```bash
rpm -qc dhcp-server
```

---

## **8. List All Files Installed by DHCP Server**  
List all files installed by the DHCP server package:  
```bash
rpm -ql dhcp-server
```

---

## **9. Edit DHCP Configuration File**  
Open the DHCP configuration file for editing:  
```bash
vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

---

## **10. Reference Example Configuration**  
Open the example configuration file for reference:  
```bash
vim /usr/share/doc/dhcp-server/dhcpd.conf.example
```

---

## **11. Start and Manage DHCP Service**  

### **Check Service Status**  
```bash
systemctl status dhcpd.service
```

### **Start DHCP Service**  
```bash
systemctl start dhcpd.service
```

### **Restart DHCP Service**  
```bash
systemctl restart dhcpd.service
```

### **Enable Service to Start at Boot**  
```bash
systemctl enable dhcpd.service
```

---

## **12. Check Open Ports**  

### **Check Open Ports and Listening Services**  
```bash
netstat -nltup
```

### **Check if DHCP Ports Are Open**  
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep dhcp
```

---

## **13. Update Firewall Rules (Firewalld)**  

### **Open DHCP Port in Firewall**  
Allow DHCP traffic through the firewall:  
```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=67/udp
```

### **Reload Firewall to Apply Changes**  
```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### **Verify Firewall Rules**  
Check if the DHCP port is open:  
```bash
firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

Alternatively, check detailed firewall configuration:  
```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

---

## **14. Check DHCP Leases**  
Display current DHCP leases:  
```bash
cat /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases
```

---

## **15. Sample DHCP Configuration**  
Below is an example of a basic **dhcpd.conf** configuration file:  

```bash
# DHCP Server Configuration File
# See /usr/share/doc/dhcp-server/dhcpd.conf.example
# See dhcpd.conf(5) man page for details

authoritative;

# Specify network address and subnet mask
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    
    # Specify the range of lease IP addresses
    range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.250;
    
    # Specify default gateway
    option routers 192.168.1.1;
    
    # DNS servers for name resolution
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
    
    # Specify broadcast address
    option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
    
    # Default lease time (in seconds)
    default-lease-time 600;
    
    # Max lease time (in seconds)
    max-lease-time 7200;
}
```
