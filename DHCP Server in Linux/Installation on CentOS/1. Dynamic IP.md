# **What is a DHCP Server?**  

A **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server** is a network server that **automatically assigns IP addresses** and other network settings (such as subnet mask, gateway, and DNS) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration on client devices.  

---

# **How DHCP Works?**  
When a device (client) connects to a network, it follows these steps to obtain an IP address from the **DHCP server**:  

1. **DHCP Discovery** (`DHCPDISCOVER`) – The client sends a broadcast request to find a DHCP server.  
2. **DHCP Offer** (`DHCPOFFER`) – The DHCP server responds with an available IP address and network settings.  
3. **DHCP Request** (`DHCPREQUEST`) – The client requests the offered IP address.  
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment** (`DHCPACK`) – The DHCP server confirms the assignment, and the client starts using the IP address.

# **Key Features of DHCP Server**  
- **Automatic IP Assignment** – Reduces manual IP configuration.  
- **Prevents IP Conflicts** – Ensures each device gets a unique IP.  
- **Centralized Network Management** – Admins can control IP address distribution from a single server.  
- **IP Lease Management** – Assigns temporary IPs, reclaiming unused ones.  
- **Supports Reserved (Static) IPs** – Assigns permanent IPs to specific devices based on their MAC address.  

---

# **Where is DHCP Used?**  
- **Home Networks** – Routers use DHCP to assign IPs to connected devices.  
- **Enterprise Networks** – Manages thousands of devices efficiently.  
- **ISP Networks** – Assigns public IPs dynamically to customer devices.

# **Focus on CentOS-Based DHCP Server**

| Feature                | CentOS                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Base OS**            | RHEL-based                   |
| **Package Manager**    | `yum` or `dnf`               |
| **DHCP Server Package**| `dhcp-server`                |
| **Config File Location**| `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`      |
| **Firewall Tool**      | `firewalld` or `iptables`    |
| **Service Management** | `systemctl`                  |

# **DHCP Server Installation & Configuration Guide (CentOS Only)**  

## **1. Update System Packages**  
Update package list to ensure you get the latest versions:  
```bash
yum update -y
```

---

## **2. Install DHCP Server Package**  
Install the DHCP server package:  
```bash
yum install dhcp-server -y
```

---

## **3. Verify Installation**  
Check if the DHCP package is installed:  
```bash
rpm -qa | grep dhcp-server
```

---

## **4. List Configuration Files for DHCP Server**  
Find the DHCP configuration files:  
```bash
rpm -ql dhcp-server
```

---

# **DHCP Server Configuration**  

## **5. Edit DHCP Configuration File**  
Open the DHCP configuration file for editing:  
```bash
nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

**Sample Configuration File:**  
```bash
# DHCP Server Configuration File
# See /usr/share/doc/dhcp-server/dhcpd.conf.example
# See dhcpd.conf(5) man page for details

authoritative;

# Specify network address and subnet mask
subnet 192.168.88.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    
    # Specify the range of lease IP addresses
    range 192.168.88.100 192.168.88.200;
    
    # Specify default gateway
    option routers 192.168.88.1;
    
    # DNS servers for name resolution
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
    
    # Specify broadcast address
    option broadcast-address 192.168.88.255;
    
    # Default lease time (in seconds)
    default-lease-time 600;
    
    # Max lease time (in seconds)
    max-lease-time 7200;
}
```

---

# **Start and Manage DHCP Service**  

**Check Service Status**  
```bash
systemctl status dhcpd
```

**Restart DHCP Service**  
```bash
systemctl restart dhcpd 
```

**Enable Service to Start at Boot**  
```bash
systemctl enable dhcpd
```

---

# **Update Firewall Rules**  

**Allow DHCP traffic through the firewall:**  
```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=67/udp
```

**Reload Firewall Service**  
```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Check if the DHCP port is open:**  
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep dhcp
```

---

# **Check DHCP Leases**  
Display current DHCP leases:  
```bash
cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
```

---

# **DHCP Client Configuration (Windows/Linux)**  

### **Windows Client**  
```powershell
ipconfig /release
```
```powershell
ipconfig /renew
```
```powershell
ipconfig
```

### **Linux Client**  
```bash
dhclient -r && dhclient
```
```bash
ip a
```
