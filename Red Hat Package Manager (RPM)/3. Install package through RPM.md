Here are the `rpm` commands to **download**, **install**, **upgrade**, and **remove** packages using **Firefox** and **VLC Media Player** as examples.

---

### **1. Download RPM Package**

To **download** an RPM package, you would generally need to fetch it from a repository or a website. You can use `wget` or `curl` to download an RPM package. However, `rpm` itself does not handle downloading the package. 

For example, to download Firefox RPM:

```bash
wget https://example.com/firefox.rpm
```

For VLC Media Player RPM:

```bash
wget https://example.com/vlc.rpm
```

You can also use `dnf` or `yum` if you're using a repository-based approach:

```bash
sudo dnf download firefox
sudo dnf download vlc
```

### **2. Install RPM Package**

To **install** an RPM package, use the `-i` (install) option with the `rpm` command:

- **Firefox installation**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -i firefox-*.rpm
  ```

- **VLC installation**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -i vlc-*.rpm
  ```

If you download the packages using `wget` as shown in the previous step, you can install them directly by referencing the `.rpm` file path.

---

### **3. Upgrade an Installed Package**

To **upgrade** an existing package, use the `-U` (upgrade) option with the `rpm` command. This will upgrade the package to the latest version.

- **Upgrade Firefox**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -U firefox-*.rpm
  ```

- **Upgrade VLC Media Player**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -U vlc-*.rpm
  ```

This command will replace the current version of the package with the newer one.

---

### **4. Remove a Package**

To **remove** a package using `rpm`, use the `-e` (erase) option followed by the package name.

- **Remove Firefox**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -e firefox
  ```

- **Remove VLC Media Player**:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -e vlc
  ```

This will remove the package from your system.
