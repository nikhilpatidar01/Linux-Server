In Linux, particularly for distributions like CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora, the yum command is used to manage packages. If you want to list all available groups of packages, you can use the following command:

1. **List all available groups:**

   ```bash
   yum group list
   ```

   This command will show all the available groups of packages, like "Development Tools," "Web Server," etc.

2. **List installed groups:**

   ```bash
   yum group list installed
   ```

   This will show you the groups that have already been installed on your system.

3. **Install a group of packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum groupinstall "Group Name"
   ```

   Replace `"Group Name"` with the name of the group you want to install (e.g., "Development Tools").

4. **Remove a group of packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum groupremove "Group Name"
   ```

   This will uninstall a group of packages.

5. **Display information about a group:**

   ```bash
   yum groupinfo "Group Name"
   ```

   This command shows details about a particular package group.

6. **Update group packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum groupupdate "Group Name"
   ```
