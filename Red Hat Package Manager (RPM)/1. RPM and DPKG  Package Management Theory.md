# 📦 **Linux Package Managers: RPM and dpkg**  

**Package Managers** allow you to install, update, and remove software efficiently. The two most widely used package managers in Linux are:  

1. **RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)** – Used in **Red Hat-based systems** (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora).  
2. **dpkg (Debian Package Manager)** – Used in **Debian-based systems** (Debian, Ubuntu).  

---

# 🏷 **1. RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)**  

### 🔹 **What is RPM?**  
RPM is the **default package manager** for **Red Hat-based** Linux distributions such as **RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and Rocky Linux**.  

### 📂 **File Format:**  
- `.rpm` (Red Hat Package Manager file)  

### 📌 **Basic RPM Commands**  

#### ✅ **Install a Package (`-i` for install)**  
```bash
rpm -i package.rpm
```
🔹 Installs a package but **fails if dependencies are missing**.  

#### ✅ **Upgrade a Package (`-U` for upgrade, `-F` for fresh install only if installed)**  
```bash
rpm -U package.rpm   # Installs or upgrades the package
rpm -F package.rpm   # Upgrades only if the package is already installed
```

#### ✅ **Remove a Package (`-e` for erase)**  
```bash
rpm -e package-name
```
🔹 Uninstalls a package but **fails if dependencies exist**.  

#### ✅ **Check If a Package Is Installed (`-q` for query)**  
```bash
rpm -q package-name
```

#### ✅ **List All Installed Packages (`-qa` for query all)**  
```bash
rpm -qa
```

#### ✅ **Find a File’s Package (`-qf` for query file)**  
```bash
rpm -qf /bin/ls
```
🔹 Shows which package installed a specific file.  

#### ✅ **Verify an Installed Package (`-V` for verify)**  
```bash
rpm -V package-name
```
🔹 Checks if any **files have been modified** since installation.  

---

### 🔥 **Using YUM or DNF (Front-end for RPM)**  

RPM does **not resolve dependencies** on its own, so we use **YUM** (older) or **DNF** (newer) to manage packages.

#### ✅ **Install a Package (With Dependency Resolution)**
```bash
sudo yum install package-name   # For RHEL 7, CentOS 7
sudo dnf install package-name   # For RHEL 8+, Fedora
```

#### ✅ **Remove a Package**  
```bash
sudo yum remove package-name
sudo dnf remove package-name
```

#### ✅ **Update All Packages**
```bash
sudo yum update
sudo dnf update
```

#### ✅ **Search for a Package**  
```bash
sudo yum search package-name
sudo dnf search package-name
```

---

# 🏷 **2. dpkg (Debian Package Manager)**  

### 🔹 **What is dpkg?**  
dpkg is the **default package manager** for **Debian-based** distributions such as **Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and Linux Mint**.  

### 📂 **File Format:**  
- `.deb` (Debian Package File)  

### 📌 **Basic dpkg Commands**  

#### ✅ **Install a `.deb` Package (`-i` for install)**  
```bash
sudo dpkg -i package.deb
```
🔹 Installs the package but **fails if dependencies are missing**.  

#### ✅ **Remove a Package (`-r` for remove, `-P` for purge)**  
```bash
sudo dpkg -r package-name  # Removes package but keeps config files
sudo dpkg -P package-name  # Removes package AND config files
```

#### ✅ **List Installed Packages (`--list`)**  
```bash
dpkg --list
```

#### ✅ **Check Details of an Installed Package (`-s` for status)**  
```bash
dpkg -s package-name
```

#### ✅ **Find a File’s Package (`-S` for search)**  
```bash
dpkg -S /usr/bin/ls
```
🔹 Shows which package installed a specific file.  

---

### 🔥 **Using APT (Front-end for dpkg)**  

Like RPM, **dpkg does not resolve dependencies**. Instead, we use **APT (Advanced Package Tool)** for better package management.

#### ✅ **Install a Package (With Dependency Resolution)**
```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

#### ✅ **Remove a Package**  
```bash
sudo apt remove package-name
```

#### ✅ **Update Package List**
```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### ✅ **Upgrade All Installed Packages**
```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

#### ✅ **Search for a Package**  
```bash
sudo apt search package-name
```

# RPM Commands

 **RPM** (Red Hat Package Manager) is primarily used for package management in Red Hat-based operating systems like RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora. However, tools like `rpm` can also be used on Debian-based systems if needed. Similarly, `dpkg` (Debian Package) can sometimes be used on Red Hat systems. This cross-usage is typically done to access specific functionalities available in one package manager but not the other.

## Checking OS Details

You can check your operating system details using the following commands:

```
 cat /etc/os-release
```
```
 cat /etc/system-release
```
```
 cat /etc/redhat-release
```
```
 uname -a
```

- `uname -a` prints all available information about the system.
  - `uname` alone prints the kernel name.
  - `-a` (all) prints all system information.

      #### Sample Output
      
      ```
      Linux localhost.localdomain 5.14.0-522.el9.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Oct 20 13:04:34 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
      ```
      
      #### Explanation of Output
      
      - **Linux**: Kernel name indicating the system is running Linux.
      - **localhost.localdomain**: Hostname of the system.
      - **5.14.0-522.el9.x86_64**: Kernel version, including:
        - **5.14.0**: Major and minor version numbers.
        - **522**: Patch level (release number).
        - **el9**: Indicates Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9) distribution.
        - **x86_64**: Architecture (64-bit x86).
      - **#1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC**: Additional kernel build information:
        - **#1**: Build number.
        - **SMP**: Symmetric Multi-Processing support.
        - **PREEMPT_DYNAMIC**: Dynamic preemption model.
      - **Sun Oct 20 13:04:34 UTC 2024**: Build date and time of the kernel.
      - **x86_64 x86_64 x86_64**: System architecture (64-bit x86).
      - **GNU/Linux**: Indicates a GNU/Linux operating system.

## Checking Available Package Managers

Run the following commands to check which package manager is available on your system:

```
 rpm
```
```
 dnf
```
```
 yum
```
```
 dpkg
```
```
 apt
```

- If it's an RPM-based system, commands like `rpm`, `dnf`, and `yum` will provide outputs.
- In Debian-based systems, `dpkg` and `apt` will be available.

## RPM Database

The RPM database is stored in `/var/lib/rpm`. List its contents using:

```
# ls /var/lib/rpm
```

Output:

```
/var/lib/rpmdb.sqlite
```
```
/var/lib/rpmdb.sqlite-shm
```
```
/var/lib/rpmdb.sqlite-wal
```

### Explanation of RPM Database Files

1. **rpmdb.sqlite** (Main RPM Database)
   - Contains all package metadata:
     - Installed packages
     - Package versions
     - Dependencies
     - File locations
     - Configuration files
   - Queried when you run `rpm -qa` (query all packages).

2. **rpmdb.sqlite-shm** (Shared Memory File)
   - Acts as temporary shared memory for SQLite transactions.
   - Improves read/write performance by caching queries.
   - Created dynamically and may not always be present.

3. **rpmdb.sqlite-wal** (Write-Ahead Log)
   - Temporarily stores uncommitted changes before writing to `rpmdb.sqlite`.
   - Ensures data consistency in case of a crash.
   - Cleared when changes are committed.

#### How RPM Uses These Files

- **Installing a Package**: When you run `rpm -i package.rpm`, RPM writes package details to `rpmdb.sqlite`, with temporary changes stored in `rpmdb.sqlite-wal`.
- **Querying Packages**: When you run `rpm -qa`, RPM reads `rpmdb.sqlite` and may use `rpmdb.sqlite-shm` to speed up queries.
- **Committing Changes**: When a transaction is committed, `rpmdb.sqlite-wal` is merged into `rpmdb.sqlite`, and `rpmdb.sqlite-wal` is cleared.

## RPM Commands

```
# rpm --version
```

Output:

```
RPM version 4.16.1.3
```

### Display RPM Help

```
# rpm --help
```

## Downloading a Package

Use `wget` to download a package:

```
 wget https://nginx.org/packages/rhel/9/x86_64/RPMS/nginx-1.26.2-2.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
```

**Before Downloading:**

- Verify the package's release, version, and architecture match your system.
- Check package dependencies and ensure they are available.
- Verify that the package does not conflict with existing installed packages.
- Check the package signature to confirm authenticity.
- Review changelogs or documentation for important updates or known issues.

---

## Querying Non-Installed Packages

### Query Information About a Non-Installed Package

#### Query Package Name

```
 rpm -qp package_file.rpm
```

- `-qp`: Query package.

Example:

```
 rpm -qp nginx-1.26.2-2.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Get Detailed Information

```
 rpm -qip package_file.rpm
```

- `-qip`: Query information about the package file.

Example:

```
 rpm -qip nginx-1.26.2-2.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
```

#### List Configuration Files

```
 rpm -qcp package_file.rpm

#### Get License Information (Non-Installed Package)

Since `-qL` is not a standard option for license, use the following:

```
 rpm -qip package_file.rpm | grep License
```

Example:

```
 rpm -qip nginx-1.26.2-2.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm | grep License
```

---

## Verifying Packages

### Verify Integrity of Installed Packages

```
 rpm -V package_name
```

- `-V`: Verify mode.
- Checks size, permissions, checksum, timestamps, etc.
- **No output** means no changes detected.
- Outputs a status string if files are modified.

#### Status String Symbols

- **S**: File size differs.
- **M**: Mode (permissions) changed.
- **5**: MD5 checksum mismatch.
- **T**: Timestamp changed.
- **D**: Device major/minor number mismatch.
- **U**: User ownership changed.
- **G**: Group ownership changed.
- **L**: Symbolic link path mismatch.
- **P**: Capabilities differ.
- **c**: Configuration file.

#### Example

```
 rpm -V openssh-server
```

Possible Output:

```
S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshd_config
missing    c /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Indicates that `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` has changes in size, MD5 checksum, and timestamp.

### Verbose Verification

```
 rpm -Vv package_name
```

- `-Vv`: Verbose verify.
- Displays detailed information about the state of each file.

Example:

```
 rpm -Vv passwd
```

### Verify Package Ignoring Dependencies

```
 rpm -Vv --nodeps package_name
```

- `--nodeps`: Ignore dependencies during verification.

Example:

```
 rpm -Vv --nodeps passwd
```

---

## Package Selection Options

Package selection refers to identifying and selecting a package for querying, verifying, or managing.

- **By Package Name**:

  ```
   rpm -q package_name
  ```

- **By File Path**:

  - Find which package owns a file:

    ```
     rpm -qf /path/to/file
    ```

  - Verify a file's integrity and ownership:

    ```
     rpm -Vf /path/to/file
    ```

- **By External Commands**:

  - Locate a command/file before querying:

    ```
     which command
    ```
    ```
     whereis command
    ```

---

## Installing Packages

Use the `-i` option to install packages.

```
 rpm -i package_file.rpm
```

- **If the package is downloaded locally**:

  ```
   rpm -i nginx-1.26.3-1.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
  ```

- **If installing directly from a URL**:

  ```
   rpm -i https://nginx.org/packages/rhel/9/x86_64/RPMS/nginx-1.26.3-1.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
  ```

### Installing Without Dependencies

```
 rpm -i package_file.rpm
```

- **Note**: If there are no dependencies, the package will install successfully.

### Installing with Unresolved Dependencies

Example:

```
 rpm -i httpd-2.4.62-4.el9.x86_64.rpm
```

- If dependencies are missing, you will receive errors indicating which dependencies are required.

#### Resolving Dependencies

Install necessary dependencies one by one:

```
 rpm -i dependency1.rpm
```
```
 rpm -i dependency2.rpm
```
```
 rpm -i package_file.rpm
```

#### Skipping Dependency Checks

```
 rpm -i --nodeps package_file.rpm
```

- **Warning**: Skipping dependencies may result in a non-functional package.

#### Verbose and Human-Readable Installation

```
 rpm -ivh package_file.rpm
```

- `-i`: Install.
- `-v`: Verbose output.
- `-h`: Display hash marks to show progress.

---

## Upgrading Packages

Use the `-U` option to upgrade a package.

```
 rpm -U package_file.rpm
```

- Upgrades an existing package or installs it if it's not already installed.
- Replaces older versions with newer ones.
- Preserves configuration files to avoid overwriting custom settings.

Example:

```
 rpm -U nginx-1.26.3-1.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm
```

---

## Uninstalling (Erasing) Packages

Use the `-e` option to uninstall a package.

```
 rpm -e package_name
```

- Checks for dependencies; will fail if other packages depend on it unless `--nodeps` is used.
- Removes installed files, except modified configuration files in `/etc/`.
- Updates the RPM database to reflect the removal.

Example:

```
 rpm -e httpd-filesystem
```

### Verbose and Human-Readable Uninstallation

```
 rpm -evh package_name
```

- `-e`: Erase (uninstall).
- `-v`: Verbose output.
- `-h`: Display hash marks to show progress.

### Forcing Uninstallation Without Dependency Checks

```
 rpm -e --nodeps package_name
```

- **Warning**: This may break other packages that depend on the removed package.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Recursive Dependencies**: When installing packages with multiple dependencies, you may need to install several packages to resolve all requirements.
- **Using `--nodeps`**: Skipping dependency checks is generally discouraged as it can lead to broken packages or system instability.
- **Configuration Files**: Uninstallation typically doesn't remove configuration files in `/etc/` to preserve user settings. These may need to be removed manually if desired.
- **Regular Verification**: It's good practice to verify package integrity periodically to detect unauthorized changes or corruption.
