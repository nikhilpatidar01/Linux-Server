# Enable Root Login via SSH

Allowing root login can be risky and is usually discouraged in production environments. Only enable root login in secure, trusted, or isolated environments (like labs or VMs).

---

## Step 1: Edit the Configuration

### Option 1: Main Config File

Edit the main SSH config:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure this line exists and is not commented:

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

### Option 2: Drop-in Config

Alternatively, create or edit the drop-in config:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf
```

Set the following:

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

This will override any conflicting settings from the main config.

---

## Step 2: Check for Conflicts

Make sure no other file still sets `PermitRootLogin` to `no`:

```bash
grep -r "PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
```

Comment or remove any lines like:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

---

## Step 3: Restart SSH

Apply the changes by restarting the SSH daemon:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## Step 4: Test Root Login

Try logging in as root (use your custom port if configured):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.1.38
```

If successful, the shell should drop you into a root session.

---

## Security Notes

- If `PasswordAuthentication no` is enabled, root login will still fail unless you use key-based authentication.
- On SELinux systems, make sure the port is allowed for SSH:

```bash
semanage port -l | grep ssh
```

- If using firewalld, make sure your port (e.g., 2222) is open:

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-port=2222/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Enabling root login via SSH should only be done in environments where it is secure and necessary.
