# Enable Root Login via SSH

Allowing root login can be risky and is usually discouraged in production environments. Only enable root login in secure, trusted, or isolated environments (like labs or VMs).

---

## Step 1: Edit the Configuration

### Option 1: Main Config File

Edit the main SSH config:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure this line exists and is not commented:

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

### Option 2: Drop-in Config

Alternatively, create or edit the drop-in config:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf
```

Set the following:

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

This will override any conflicting settings from the main config.

---

## Step 2: Check for Conflicts

Make sure no other file still sets `PermitRootLogin` to `no`:

```bash
grep -r "PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
```

Comment or remove any lines like:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

---

## Step 3: Restart SSH

Apply the changes by restarting the SSH daemon:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## Step 4: Test Root Login

Try logging in as root (use your custom port if configured):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.1.38
```

If successful, the shell should drop you into a root session.

---

## Security Notes

- If `PasswordAuthentication no` is enabled, root login will still fail unless you use key-based authentication.
- On SELinux systems, make sure the port is allowed for SSH:

```bash
semanage port -l | grep ssh
```

- If using firewalld, make sure your port (e.g., 2222) is open:

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-port=2222/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Enabling root login via SSH should only be done in environments where it is secure and necessary.

A `Connection timed out` error while trying to SSH (`ssh root@192.168.95.146`) usually means that your computer couldn't establish a connection to port 22 on that IP address. Here are common causes and how to troubleshoot:

---

### âœ… **Checklist to Fix SSH Timeout Issue**

#### 1. **Check if the Server is Up**
Make sure the machine with IP `192.168.95.146` is powered on and connected to the network.

- Try to ping the server:
  ```cmd
  ping 192.168.95.146
  ```
  - If there's no reply, it's either powered off or not connected.

#### 2. **Verify SSH Service is Running on Target Machine**
If it's a Linux server, run this command on that machine:
```bash
systemctl status sshd
```
- If it's inactive, start it:
  ```bash
  systemctl start sshd
```

#### 3. **Check Firewall Rules**
On the server (`192.168.95.146`), ensure port 22 is allowed through the firewall.

- On **CentOS/RHEL** (using `firewalld`):
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

#### 4. **Check if Port 22 is Listening**
On the server:
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :22
```
- You should see something like:
  ```
  tcp   0   0 0.0.0.0:22   0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN   sshd
  ```
