# 🔐 Managing Access with `hosts.allow` and `hosts.deny`

The files `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` are part of the **TCP Wrappers** system, used to restrict or allow access to network services on Unix-like systems.

Services that are compiled with `libwrap` (like `sshd`, `vsftpd`, etc.) can be controlled using these files.

- `/etc/hosts.allow`: Specifies which hosts **are allowed** access.
- `/etc/hosts.deny`: Specifies which hosts **are denied** access.

## 🚫 Denying Host Access

### 📝 Edit `/etc/hosts.deny`

To deny SSH access to specific hosts or subnets, use:

```bash
vim /etc/hosts.deny
```

### 🔧 Example Configuration:

```bash
# /etc/hosts.deny - Deny access rules for TCP Wrappers
# See 'man 5 hosts_options' and 'man 5 hosts_access' for rule syntax
# See 'man tcpd' for information on TCP Wrappers

sshd : 192.168.95.150
sshd : 192.168.95.*
sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0
sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0 EXCEPT 192.168.95.150
```

### 📌 Explanation:
- `sshd : 192.168.95.150` → Deny SSH from one specific IP.
- `sshd : 192.168.95.*` → Deny SSH from all IPs in the range.
- `sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0` → Subnet-style block.
- `EXCEPT` → Make exceptions even if a subnet is blocked.

## ✅ Allowing Host Access

### 🔁 Option 1: Block All, Then Allow Specific IPs

A secure way to control access: **deny all by default**, then allow specific IPs.

---

### Step 1: Deny All SSH Access

Edit `/etc/hosts.deny`:

```bash
vim /etc/hosts.deny
```

Add this to block all by default:

```bash
# /etc/hosts.deny - Deny all access by default
# Deny connections to services that use tcp_wrappers or are xinetd-enabled

sshd : ALL
```

---

### Step 2: Allow a Specific IP in `/etc/hosts.allow`

Edit `/etc/hosts.allow`:

```bash
vim /etc/hosts.allow
```

Add this to allow a specific IP:

```bash
# /etc/hosts.allow - Allow SSH access from specific IP
sshd : 192.168.95.150
```

## 🧠 Notes

- ⚠️ These settings only affect services compiled with **TCP Wrappers** (`libwrap`), such as `sshd`, `vsftpd`, `rpcbind`, etc.
- ✅ Always keep a second SSH session open when testing changes, to avoid locking yourself out.
- 🔐 Combine with `ufw` or `iptables` for a layered security setup.
- 🛠️ For more control, use `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with `AllowUsers`, `DenyUsers`, or `Match` blocks.
