# 🌐 Bind SSH to a Specific IP Address on CentOS/RHEL

By default, the SSH daemon (`sshd`) listens on **all available network interfaces**. You can restrict it to a specific IP address using the `ListenAddress` directive in the SSH configuration. This improves security in multi-interface environments or when isolating services by IP.

---

## 📝 Step 1: Edit the SSH Configuration File

Open the SSH configuration file:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find and set the `ListenAddress` directive to the desired IP address:

```bash
ListenAddress 192.168.1.38
```

If you're also changing the port (e.g., from `22` to `2222`), ensure the `Port` directive is updated as well:

```bash
Port 2222
```

> 💡 You can specify **multiple `ListenAddress`** entries if SSH should listen on more than one IP.

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Restart the SSH Service

Restart the SSH daemon to apply the configuration changes:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Verify SSH is Listening on the Correct IP and Port

Use `netstat` or `ss` to confirm SSH is bound to the correct IP and port:

### Using netstat:

```bash
netstat -nltup | grep sshd
```

### Using ss (alternative):

```bash
ss -nltup | grep sshd
```

Expected output (example):

```
tcp   0   0 192.168.1.38:2222   0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN   <PID>/sshd
```

## 📁 Sample SSH Configuration Snippet (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)

```bash
nano vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

```

```bash
Port 2222
ListenAddress 192.168.1.38
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
AcceptEnv LANG
Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server
```

> ⚠️ If present, you can **comment out** the following to prevent the daemon from listening on all interfaces:
>
> ```bash
> # ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
> # ListenAddress ::
> ```
