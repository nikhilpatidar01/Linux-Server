## What is (SCP) Secure Copy ðŸ”¹

Secure Copy (SCP) is a network protocol used to securely transfer files between a local and a remote system, or between two remote systems, over an encrypted SSH connection. It ensures data integrity and confidentiality during the transfer by encrypting the files and authentication details.

## Secure Copy (SCP) ðŸ”¹

### ðŸ”¸ To send a single file to a specific directory on the remote server:  
```bash
scp file.txt user@192.168.1.34:/home/user/
```
```bash
scp ftp-server.py user@192.168.1.31:/tmp/
```
**Explanation**:  
- Copies `file.txt` and `ftp-server.py` from the local system to the specified remote directories (`/home/user/`, `/tmp/`).

---

### ðŸ”¸ To transfer multiple files at once to the remote system:  
```bash
scp file1.txt file2.txt user@192.168.1.34:/home/user/
```
```bash
scp image.png notes.md user@192.168.1.100:/var/www/html/
```
**Explanation**:  
- Transfers multiple files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `image.png`, `notes.md`) to the specified directory on the remote server.

---

### ðŸ”¸ To recursively copy an entire directory and its contents from the local system to the remote system:  
```bash
scp -r /local/dir user@192.168.1.34:/remote/dir
```
```bash
scp -r ~/Downloads user@192.168.1.34:/tmp/
```
**Explanation**:  
- Uses the `-r` option to copy a directory and its contents recursively from the local system to the remote server.

---

### ðŸ”¸ To copy a file or folder from the remote server to the local machine:  
```bash
scp user@192.168.1.34:/home/user/file.txt ./local/dir/
```
```bash
scp -r user@192.168.1.34:/var/www/html/ /tmp/
```
**Explanation**:  
- Copies a file or directory from the remote server to the local machine. The `-r` option is used for directories.

---

### ðŸ”¸ To set a bandwidth limit during transfer (useful for slow networks):  
```bash
scp -l 500 file.zip user@192.168.1.20:/tmp/
```
**Explanation**:  
- The `-l` option sets a bandwidth limit in kilobits per second (500 kbps in this case) to prevent network congestion.

### **Conclusion on Secure Copy (SCP)** ðŸ”¹

1. **Secure File Transfer**:  
   SCP securely transfers files using an encrypted SSH connection.

2. **Data Integrity**:  
   It encrypts files and authentication details, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.

3. **Multiple File Transfers**:  
   SCP supports transferring multiple files simultaneously.

4. **Directory Transfer**:  
   With `-r`, SCP can copy entire directories and their contents.

5. **Local and Remote Transfers**:  
   SCP supports both local-to-remote and remote-to-local file transfers.

6. **Bandwidth Limiting**:  
   The `-l` option lets you set bandwidth limits for transfers.

7. **Simplicity and Security**:  
   SCP is easy to use and ensures secure file transfer via SSH.
