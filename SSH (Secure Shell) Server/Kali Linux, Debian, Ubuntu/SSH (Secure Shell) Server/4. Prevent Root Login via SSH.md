# Prevent Root Login via SSH

Restricting root login over SSH is a recommended security measure to reduce attack surfaces and enforce the use of individual user accounts.

---

## Step 1: Edit the SSH Configuration

You can define `PermitRootLogin no` in either the main SSH configuration or a separate drop-in override file.

### Option 1: Modify the Main Config File

Open the main SSH configuration:

```bash
 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify this directive:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

Remove or comment out any conflicting `PermitRootLogin yes` directives.

### Option 2: Use Drop-In Configuration (Preferred)

Modern systems support modular configuration using `.d` directories:

```bash
 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf
```

Add the directive:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

If the file was auto-created by an installer (like Anaconda), you can edit or delete it as needed.

---

## Step 2: Validate Configuration

Check for conflicting or duplicate `PermitRootLogin` entries:

```bash
 grep -ri "PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
```

Make sure no other config file sets it to `yes`.

---

## Step 3: Restart SSHD

Apply changes by restarting the SSH daemon:

```bash
 systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## Step 4: Test SSH Access

Try connecting via a non-root user:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 armoura@192.168.1.38
```

Trying to log in as `root` should now result in:

```
Permission denied
```

## Sample SSH Configuration (Combined View)

### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (Excerpt)

```bash
Port 2222
ListenAddress 192.168.1.38
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf`

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

Configuration is now secure and root SSH login is blocked.
