# 🔓 Enable Root Login via SSH (Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian)

Allowing root login is a security risk and generally discouraged in production. Enable it only in secure, trusted, or isolated environments such as VMs, labs, or local setups.

---

## 📝 Step 1: Edit the SSH Configuration

### 🔧 Option 1: Modify the Main Config File

Edit the main SSH configuration:

```bash
 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure the following line exists **and is not commented** (i.e., no `#` at the beginning):

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

### 🧩 Option 2: Use Drop-In Configuration (Recommended)

Create or edit a drop-in file:

```bash
 vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf
```

Add this line:

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

This overrides any conflicting settings from the main file.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Check for Conflicts

Ensure no other file disables root login:

```bash
 grep -r "PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
```

If you find:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

Either comment it out or remove the conflicting line.

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Restart the SSH Service

Apply the configuration changes:

```bash
 systemctl restart ssh
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Root SSH Access

Try logging in as root from a client system (replace with your actual IP and port):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.1.38
```

If successful, you’ll be logged in as root.

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- If `PasswordAuthentication no` is enabled, you must use SSH keys to log in as root.
- On Kali/Ubuntu/Debian, **SELinux is usually not enforced** by default, so `semanage` is typically not required.
- Make sure the SSH port (e.g., `2222`) is allowed through the firewall:

### 🔥 If using UFW (default on Ubuntu/Debian/Kali):

```bash
 ufw allow 2222/tcp
 ufw reload
```

Check status:

```bash
 ufw status
```

### 📁 Example Combined Configuration

#### `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (excerpt):

```bash
Port 2222
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

#### `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01.permitrootlogin.conf`

```bash
PermitRootLogin yes
```

---

✅ **Root SSH login is now enabled. Use with caution.**
