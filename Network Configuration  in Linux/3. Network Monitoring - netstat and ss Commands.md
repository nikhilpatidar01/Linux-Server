# Network Monitoring with `netstat` and `ss`

`netstat` and `ss` are both network-related commands used for monitoring and troubleshooting network connections on a system.


## `netstat` Commands

`netstat` (Network Statistics) is an older command that displays network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics.

### **Basic `netstat` Commands:**

```bash
netstat
```
Displays the current network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```
Displays all listening ports (TCP and UDP) along with the process IDs (PID).

```bash
netstat -an
```
Shows all network connections with IP addresses, without resolving hostnames.

```bash
netstat -r
```
Displays the routing table.

```bash
netstat -i
```
Displays information about network interfaces.

```bash
netstat -s
```
Displays network statistics for each protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).

```bash
netstat -p
```
Displays the PID and program name for each connection.

## `ss` Commands

`ss` (Socket Statistics) is a faster and more detailed tool than `netstat`, as it directly accesses data from `procfs`.

### **Basic `ss` Commands:**

```bash
ss
```
Displays all active socket connections.

```bash
ss -tulnp
```
Displays all listening ports (TCP and UDP) along with the process IDs (PID), similar to `netstat -tulnp`.

```bash
ss -s
```
Shows a summary of active connections.

```bash
ss -an
```
Displays all network connections with IP addresses, without resolving hostnames.

```bash
ss -tn
```
Shows all TCP connections.

```bash
ss -u
```
Displays all UDP connections.

```bash
ss -p
```
Displays the processes associated with each socket.

```bash
ss -l
```
Displays only listening sockets.

```bash
ss -4
```
Shows IPv4 connections only.

```bash
ss -6
```
Shows IPv6 connections only.

```bash
ss -r
```
Resolves hostnames for network addresses (like `netstat -n`).

## **Advanced `ss` Commands:**

```bash
ss -tuln
```
Displays all listening ports (TCP and UDP), without resolving hostnames.

```bash
ss -ltnp
```
Shows listening TCP ports along with the process ID (PID) and process name.

```bash
ss -o state established '( dport = :http or sport = :http )'
```
Displays HTTP connections, either incoming or outgoing.

```bash
ss -a
```
Displays both listening and non-listening sockets.

```bash
ss -p sport = :22
```
Shows connections on port 22 (SSH).

## **Comparison between `netstat` and `ss`:**

| **Feature**    | **`netstat`**       | **`ss`**            |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Performance    | Slow                | Fast                |
| Data Source    | `/proc/net/*` & Kernel Calls | Directly from Kernel (`procfs`) |
| Accuracy       | Moderate            | High                |
| Deprecated?    | Yes                 | No                  |
