# Network Monitoring with `netstat` and `ss`

`netstat` and `ss` are both network-related commands used for monitoring and troubleshooting network connections on a system.

---

## 1️⃣ **`netstat` (Network Statistics)**

🔹 This is an older but effective command that provides information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masqueraded connections, and multicast memberships on the system.  
🔹 It is part of the `net-tools` package but is being replaced by `ss` on modern systems.

#### **Some important options of `netstat`:**

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```
Displays all listening ports (TCP and UDP) with PID.

```bash
netstat -an
```
Displays all network connections with IPs.

```bash
netstat -r
```
Displays the routing table.

```bash
netstat -i
```
Provides details of network interfaces.

## 2️⃣ **`ss` (Socket Statistics)**

🔹 The `ss` command is faster and more detailed than `netstat` because it directly accesses data from `procfs`.  
🔹 It is especially useful for analyzing TCP and UDP sockets.  
🔹 It is installed with the `iproute2` package.

#### **Some important options of `ss`:**

```bash
ss -tulnp
```
Displays all listening ports (TCP and UDP) with PID.

```bash
ss -s
```
Shows a summary of how many connections are active.

```bash
ss -tn
```
Displays information about all TCP connections.

```bash
ss -u
```
Displays all UDP connections.

```bash
ss -p
```
Displays processes associated with the connections.

## **💡 Key Differences:**

| **Feature**    | **netstat**       | **ss**            |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Performance    | Slow              | Fast              |
| Data Source    | `/proc/net/*` & Kernel Calls | Directly from Kernel (`procfs`) |
| Accuracy       | Moderate          | High              |
| Deprecated?    | Yes               | No                |

---

## **📌 Conclusion:**
👉 `netstat` may still be useful on older systems, but on modern systems, `ss` is preferred as it provides faster and more accurate data.  
👉 The `ss -tulnp` command is highly useful for network troubleshooting and monitoring. 🚀
