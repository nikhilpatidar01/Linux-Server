# Process Management in Linux

Process management is essential for monitoring and controlling system performance. Below are commands for managing processes in Linux.

---

## Running Commands in the Background & Foreground

### Running a Command in the Foreground
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```
Runs `ping` in the foreground.

### Running a Command in the Background
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8 &
```
Runs `ping` in the background (background process).

### Bringing a Job to the Foreground
```bash
fg
```
Brings the last background job to the foreground.

### Sending a Sequence/Ping to `/dev/null` in the Background
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null &
seq 100000000000000000000000 > /dev/null &
```

### Viewing Background Jobs
```bash
jobs
```
Lists all background jobs.

### Bringing a Specific Job to the Foreground
```bash
fg 2
```
Brings job number 2 to the foreground.

---

## Viewing Processes with `ps` Command

### Show Processes Running in the Current Shell Session
```bash
ps
```

### Display More Details About Running Processes
```bash
ps -aux
```
Lists all processes with CPU and memory usage (BSD-style).

### Show Processes Using Standard Syntax
```bash
ps -axjf
```
Displays processes in a hierarchical tree format.

### Show Processes Owned by Root
```bash
ps -U root -u root u
```

### Show Processes Owned by a Specific User
```bash
ps -U armour -u armour u
```

---

## Monitoring Processes in Real-Time

### Display Real-Time System Processes
```bash
top
```

### Alternative: `htop` (Better Alternative to `top`)

#### Install `htop`

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
apt install htop
```

On RHEL/CentOS:
```bash
yum install htop
```

#### Display `htop`
```bash
htop
```

#### Show Processes in a Tree Structure
```bash
htop -t
```

#### Show Processes for a Specific User
```bash
htop -u armour
```

#### Show Details of a Specific Process by PID
```bash
htop -p 2780
```

---

This provides a clear, step-by-step reference for process management commands in Linux, with an emphasis on background/foreground processes and process monitoring with `ps`, `top`, and `htop`.

# Killing Processes in Linux

Process management includes terminating and forcefully killing processes when needed. Below are the commands used to kill processes in Linux.

---

## Killing a Specific Process

### Send a Termination Signal to a Process
```bash
kill 2526
```
Sends a termination signal to process `2526`.

### Forcefully Kill a Process Using SIGKILL
```bash
kill -9 1891
```
Forcefully kills process `1891` using the `SIGKILL` signal.

---

## Killing All Instances of a Process

### Kill All Instances of `seq`
```bash
yum install psmisc
killall seq
```
Kills all instances of `seq`.

### Kill All Processes with Names Matching `firefox` (Using Regex)
```bash
killall -r firefox
```
Kills all processes with names matching `firefox` (using regular expressions).

### Kill All Processes Owned by a Specific User
```bash
killall -u armour
```
Kills all processes owned by the user `armour`.

### Kill All `ping` Processes Using `pkill`
```bash
pkill ping
```
Kills all `ping` processes.

### Kill All Processes for User `armour` Using `pkill`
```bash
pkill -u armour
```
Kills all processes for the user `armour`.

### Kill Exact Match for `ping` Process Owned by `armour`
```bash
pkill -u armour -x ping
```
Kills the exact match for `ping` process owned by `armour`.
