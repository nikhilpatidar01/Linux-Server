## SSL Bump with Squid Proxy üîí

### How HTTPS Works üîê
HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to securely encrypt communication between clients and servers.

1. **The Private Key**üîë: ‚Äì This key is controlled by the owner of a website and, as the reader may have guessed, it is kept *private*. It resides on the web server and is used to decrypt information that has been encrypted using the public key.

2. **The Public Key** üåç:  ‚Äì This key is available to anyone who wants to interact with the server securely. Information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the private key.

### Create SSL Certificates for Squid üõ†Ô∏è

#### Generate a Self-Signed CA (Certificate Authority) Certificate for Squid üîë

Create the directory to store the SSL certificates:
```bash
 mkdir -p /etc/squid/ssl_cert
```
```bash
cd /etc/squid/ssl_cert
```
```bash
 openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout squidCA.key -out squidCA.crt
```
```bash
 cat squidCA.crt squidCA.key > squidCA.pem
```

#### Verify that the certificate files are created ‚úÖ

Check the directory:
```bash
ls -lh /etc/squid/ssl_cert
```
You should see `squidCA.key`, `squidCA.crt`, and `squidCA.pem`.

---

### Prepare the SSL Database for Squid üóÉÔ∏è

Create and initialize the SSL database Squid uses for dynamic certificate generation:
```bash
 mkdir -p /var/lib/squid
```
```bash
 /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -c -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 20MB
```
```bash
 chown -R squid:squid /var/lib/squid/ssl_db/
```

Check the database:
```bash
ls -lh /var/lib/squid/ssl_db/
```

---

### Disable AppArmor (Ubuntu/Debian) or SELinux (Kali Linux) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Disabling SELinux (for Kali) or AppArmor (for Debian/Ubuntu) may avoid permission issues when running Squid in SSL bump mode.

For **Ubuntu/Debian**, disable AppArmor:
```bash
 systemctl stop apparmor
 systemctl disable apparmor
```

For **Kali Linux**, edit the SELinux configuration file:
```bash
 vim /etc/selinux/config
```
Set:
```bash
SELINUX=disabled
```

Check the status:
```bash
sestatus
```

---

### Configure Squid for SSL Bump ‚öôÔ∏è

Edit the Squid configuration file:
```bash
 vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
```

Update it with the following configuration:

```bash
# Squid normally listens to port 3128
# http_port 3128
http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert/squidCA.pem generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB

# SSL Bump Configuration
acl step1 at_step SslBump1
ssl_bump peek step1
ssl_bump bump all

# SSL Proxy Settings
http_access allow all

sslcrtd_program /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB
sslcrtd_children 5
dns_v4_first on
```

### Main Configuration File Example üìÑ

```bash
#
# Recommended minimum configuration:
#

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
# should be allowed
acl localnet src 0.0.0.0/8           # RFC 1122 "this" network (LAN)
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8          # RFC 1918 local private network (LAN)

acl localnet src fe80::/10           # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines

acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80            # http
acl Safe_ports port 21            # ftp
acl Safe_ports port 443           # https
acl Safe_ports port 70            # gopher
acl Safe_ports port 210           # wais

acl Safe_ports port 591           # filemaker
acl Safe_ports port 777           # multiling http

#
# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

# We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
# web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
# one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
# http_access deny to_localhost

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
# http_port 3128
http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert/squidCA.pem generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB

# SSL Bump Configuration
acl step1 at_step SslBump1
ssl_bump peek step1
ssl_bump bump all

# SSL Proxy Settings
http_access allow all

sslcrtd_program /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB
sslcrtd_children 5
dns_v4_first on

# Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
# cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid

#
# Add any of your own refresh_pattern entries above these.
#
refresh_pattern ^ftp:           1440    20%     10080

### Restart Squid üîÑ

Apply the configuration changes:
```bash
 systemctl restart squid
```

Verify Squid is running and listening:
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep squid
```
You should see Squid listening on port 3128. ‚úÖ

---

### Enable IP Forwarding üåê

Edit the sysctl configuration:
```bash
 vim /etc/sysctl.d/ipv4_forward.conf
```

Add the following line:
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

Apply the changes:
```bash
 sysctl --system
```

Verify IP forwarding is enabled:
```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

**Expected Output**:
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

---

### Configure UFW for Squid Proxy and IP Forwarding üî•

Open necessary ports (Squid proxy and HTTP):
```bash
 ufw allow 3128/tcp
```
```bash
 ufw allow 80/tcp
```

Enable IP forwarding:
```bash
 ufw default allow routed
```

Enable masquerading (required for IP forwarding/NAT):
```bash
 ufw route allow from any to any port 3128 proto tcp
```

Reload firewall rules:
```bash
 ufw reload
```

Verify changes:
```bash
 ufw status
```

**Output Example**:
```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
3128/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
```

---

### Distribute the Squid CA Certificate to Clients üì°

Serve the Squid CA certificate over HTTP:
Copy the certificate to the web server directory (Apache must be installed and running):
```bash
 cp -v /etc/squid/ssl_cert/squidCA.crt /var/www/html/
```

Clients can download it by accessing:
```
http://<proxy-server-ip>/squidCA.crt
```

**Example** (if your proxy server IP is `192.168.2.1`):
```
http://192.168.1.1/squidCA.crt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Ensure the port is correct (`80` by default unless otherwise configured).

### ‚ùå Error Message (Sample Squid Error) ‚ö†Ô∏è

```
The requested URL could not be retrieved
URL: //‚Äî.googl.com/
Connection to 2003 failed. System returned: (101) Network is unreachable
```

**Explanation**: Squid tried to connect to an **IPv6 address** which is **not reachable** or misconfigured.

---

### ‚úÖ Solutions:

1. **Force Squid to Prefer IPv4**:
   ```bash
    vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
   ```
   Add at the **top** of the file:
   ```bash
   dns_v4_first on
   ```

   Restart Squid:
   ```bash
    systemctl restart squid
   ```

2. **Disable IPv6 System-Wide** (if not using IPv6):
   ```bash
    vim /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```
   Add:
   ```bash
   net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
   net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
   ```

   Apply changes:
   ```bash
    sysctl -p
   ```

3. **Correct the URL Typo**:
   Wrong URL:
   ```
   https://waq.googt.com/
   ```
   Correct URL:
   ```
   https://www.google.com/
   ```
