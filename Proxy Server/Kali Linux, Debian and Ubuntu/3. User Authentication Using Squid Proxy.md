# What is User Authentication
**User Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of users trying to access a system. In Squid Proxy, it requires users to enter a username and password before they can access the internet. This helps control access, monitor usage, and enhance security.

Squid supports various authentication methods, such as:
1. **Basic Authentication**: Simple username and password check.
2. **NTLM Authentication**: Integrates with Windows Active Directory.
3. **Digest Authentication**: More secure, uses hashed credentials.

## 1. User Authentication

### 1.1 Enable Basic NCSA Authentication in Squid

#### 1.1.1 Install Required Tools

Install the `apache2-utils` package, which provides the `htpasswd` command:

```bash
 apt update
 apt install apache2-utils -y
```

#### 1.1.2 Create the Password File and Users

- Create the password file and add the first user:

  ```bash
   htpasswd -c /etc/squid/passwd ul
  ```

- Add additional users (without the `-c` flag):

  ```bash
   htpasswd /etc/squid/passwd u2
  ```

- Confirm the file contents:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/squid/passwd
  ```

- Set correct permissions:

  ```bash
   chgrp squid /etc/squid/passwd
   chmod 640 /etc/squid/passwd
  ```

#### 1.1.3 Update `squid.conf` for Authentication

- Edit your Squid configuration file:

  ```bash
   vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
  ```

- Add ACLs and authentication rules in the configuration file:
 
 ```bash
  #
  # INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
  #
  acl ncsa_users proxy_auth REQUIRED
  auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
  auth_param basic realm Squid Proxy Authentication
  http_access allow ncsa_users
  ```

- Optional: You can also restrict access to specific users:

  ```bash
  acl allowed_users proxy_auth u1 u2
  http_access allow allowed_users
  ```

- Make sure the `http_access allow` line appears **before** any general `http_access deny all` rules, or it will be ignored.

#### 1.1.4 Restart Squid

To apply the configuration:

```bash
 systemctl restart squid
```

### 1.2 Test the Proxy

- Try accessing any website via Squid in a browser â€” it should prompt for a username and password. Only the users defined in `/etc/squid/passwd` will be able to connect.

### 1.3 Notes & Tips

- **Backup**: Always back up your `squid.conf` before making changes.
- **Manage Users**: You can manage users later using `htpasswd`:
  - Add a user:  
    ```bash
     htpasswd /etc/squid/passwd newuser
    ```
  - Delete a user:  
    Manually edit the file and remove the corresponding line.
- **Check Logs**: To monitor access logs, use:

  ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
  ```
