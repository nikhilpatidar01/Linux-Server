# Network Configuration in Linux

## Network Configuration Basics

The following commands help manage and verify network settings:

```bash
# nmtui
```
Opens a text-based user interface for configuring network connections.

```bash
# hostname
```
Displays or sets the system's hostname.

```bash
# hostname -i
```
Shows the system's IP address associated with the hostname.

```bash
# hostname -I
```
Lists all assigned IP addresses.

```bash
# ip addr show
```
Displays details of all network interfaces.

```bash
# vim /etc/hostname
```
To manually set the hostname to `server2.armour.local`, update `/etc/hostname`:

```bash
server2.armour.local
```

```bash
# ifconfig
```
Displays network interface configurations.

```bash
# ip ad
```
Similar to `ip addr show`, lists network interfaces and IPs.

**Check Public IP Address:**
- [ifconfig.me](http://ifconfig.me/) — A web-based method to check public IP.
```bash
# curl -4 ifconfig.me
```

- [icanhazip.com](https://icanhazip.com/) — Another web-based method to check public IP.
```bash
# curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

```bash
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
Shows DNS resolver settings.

```bash
# route -n
```
Displays the kernel routing table.

```bash
# ip route
```
Displays and manipulates the system's routing table (part of the `iproute2` package).

## Configuring Static IP Address

To configure a static IP address using NetworkManager:

1. Navigate to the NetworkManager system connections directory:
   ```bash
   # cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
   ```

2. Open the connection file (`enp0s3.nmconnection`) with `vim`:
   ```bash
   # vim enp0s3.nmconnection
   ```

3. Modify the configuration file with a static IP:
   ```ini
   [connection]
   id=enp0s3
   uuid=668303d1-82bf-0f35-27891838
   type=ethernet
   autoconnect-priority=-999
   interface-name=enp0s3
   timestamp=1720179824

   [ethernet]

   [ipv4]
   address1=192.168.1.31/24,192.168.1.1
   dns=8.8.8.8;
   method=manual

   [ipv6]
   addr-gen-mode=eui64
   method=ignore
   ```

## Configuring Dynamic IP (DHCP)

To configure a DHCP (Dynamic IP):

1. Navigate to the NetworkManager system connections directory:
   ```bash
   # cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
   ```

2. Open the connection file (`enp0s3.nmconnection`) with `vim`:
   ```bash
   # vim enp0s3.nmconnection
   ```

3. Modify the configuration file for DHCP:
   ```ini
   [connection]
   id=enp0s3
   uuid=a32babc0-fbae-3089-b858-40d62bd6d445
   type=ethernet
   autoconnect-priority=-999
   interface-name=enp0s3
   timestamp=1739793171

   [ethernet]

   [ipv4]
   method=auto

   [ipv6]
   addr-gen-mode=eui64
   method=disabled

   [proxy]
   method=auto
   ```

> **Note:** Enabling DHCP allows the system to obtain an IP address automatically.

### Example Static IP Configuration in NetworkManager

```ini
[connection]
id=enp0s3
uuid=a32babc0-fbae-3089-b858-40d62bd6d445
type=ethernet
autoconnect-priority=-999
interface-name=enp0s3
timestamp=1739793171

[ethernet]

[ipv4]
address1=192.168.1.34/24
address2=192.168.1.35/24
address3=192.168.1.36/24
address4=192.168.1.37/24
dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
gateway=192.168.1.1
method=manual

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=eui64
method=disabled

[proxy]
```

## Network Configuration in Debian

Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```ini
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
    address 192.168.1.28
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.1.0
    broadcast 192.168.1.255
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8

# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
iface enp0s3 inet6 auto
```

---

**Additional Information:**
- **`ifconfig` Command:** Used to configure and retrieve information about network interfaces. Although deprecated in favor of `ip` commands, it is still widely used.
- **`ip` Command:** A modern tool to manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels.
- **NetworkManager:** A service that manages network connections automatically, often used in modern Linux distributions.
