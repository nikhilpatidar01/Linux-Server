```bash
iostat
```
- Shows CPU usage and disk I/O statistics.

2️⃣ **Show reports in MB instead of blocks**  
```bash
iostat -m
```

3️⃣ **Continuously update every 2 seconds, display 5 times**  
```bash
iostat 2 5
```

4️⃣ **Show detailed device statistics**  
```bash
iostat -d
```

5️⃣ **Show extended device utilization report**  
```bash
iostat -x
```

6️⃣ **Display CPU statistics only**  
```bash
iostat -c
```

---

### **🛠️ Why Use `iostat`?**
✅ Identify slow disks  
✅ Monitor CPU utilization  
✅ Analyze read/write operations  
✅ Optimize system performance

### 🔎 **`lsof`** – List Open Files in Linux  

The **`lsof`** (List Open Files) command in Linux is used to **list all open files** by processes. Since **everything in Linux is a file** (including sockets, pipes, devices, etc.), `lsof` is a powerful tool for monitoring **system activity, debugging issues, and identifying resource usage**.

---

### **📌 Syntax:**  
```bash
lsof [OPTIONS]
```

---

### **🔎 Common Usage & Examples:**  

1️⃣ **List all open files**  
```bash
lsof
```

2️⃣ **Find which process is using a specific file**  
```bash
lsof /path/to/file
```
🔹 Useful when you can't delete or modify a file due to "File in Use" errors.

3️⃣ **Find which process is using a specific port (e.g., port 80)**  
```bash
lsof -i :80
```
🔹 Helps identify which process is using a network port.

4️⃣ **List files opened by a specific user**  
```bash
lsof -u username
```

5️⃣ **List open files of a specific process (PID 1234)**  
```bash
lsof -p 1234
```

6️⃣ **List open files by a specific command/process (e.g., `apache2`)**  
```bash
lsof -c apache2
```

7️⃣ **List network connections (TCP and UDP ports)**  
```bash
lsof -i
```

8️⃣ **Show open files by a specific protocol (e.g., TCP)**  
```bash
lsof -i tcp
```

9️⃣ **Find deleted files still in use (which might be causing disk space issues)**  
```bash
lsof | grep deleted
```
🔹 Useful when a process is holding onto a deleted file, preventing space from being freed.

🔟 **Kill the process using a specific file**  
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -t /path/to/file)
```
🔹 `-t` returns only PIDs, which are passed to `kill`.

---

### **🛠️ Why Use `lsof`?**
✅ Troubleshoot **"File in Use" errors**  
✅ Identify **which process is using a port**  
✅ Monitor **network activity**  
✅ Detect **deleted files still consuming disk space**  
✅ Debug **file and resource issues**

### 🌐 **`kill` Command in Linux** – Terminate a Process  

The **`kill`** command in Linux is used to **terminate or signal processes**. It sends a specified signal to a process, instructing it to terminate or perform another action.  

---

### **📌 Syntax:**  
```bash
kill [OPTIONS] <PID>
```
- `PID` (Process ID) is required to specify which process to terminate.
- Signals can be specified using numbers (e.g., `9` for force kill) or names (e.g., `SIGTERM`).

---

### **🚀 Commonly Used Kill Signals**  

| Signal Number | Signal Name | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| `1` | `SIGHUP` | Reloads configuration (useful for daemons) |
| `9` | `SIGKILL` | Forcefully kills a process (cannot be ignored) |
| `15` | `SIGTERM` | Gracefully stops a process (default signal) |

---

### **🔎 Usage Examples**  

1️⃣ **Find the PID of a process**  
```bash
ps aux | grep process_name
```

2️⃣ **Kill a process by PID**  
```bash
kill 1234
```
🔹 Sends the default `SIGTERM` (graceful shutdown).

3️⃣ **Forcefully kill a process**  
```bash
kill -9 1234
```
🔹 Uses `SIGKILL` to **immediately terminate** the process.

4️⃣ **Kill multiple processes at once**  
```bash
kill -9 1234 5678 91011
```

5️⃣ **Kill all processes of a specific name**  
```bash
pkill process_name
```
🔹 Kills all instances of a process.

6️⃣ **Kill all processes by a specific user**  
```bash
pkill -u username
```

7️⃣ **Kill processes by pattern**  
```bash
pkill -f "process_name"
```
🔹 Matches the full command line.

8️⃣ **Kill all instances of a program (e.g., Firefox)**  
```bash
killall firefox
```
🔹 Terminates all running instances of `firefox`.

9️⃣ **Gracefully restart a service (e.g., Apache)**  
```bash
kill -HUP $(pidof apache2)
```
🔹 Reloads Apache without stopping it.

🔟 **Check if a process is running before killing it**  
```bash
pgrep process_name
```
🔹 Returns PIDs of running processes.

---

### **🛠️ Why Use `kill`?**
✅ Stop **unresponsive programs**  
✅ Restart **services gracefully**  
✅ Free up **system resources**  
✅ Maintain **system stability**  

🚀 **A powerful tool for process management in Linux!**
