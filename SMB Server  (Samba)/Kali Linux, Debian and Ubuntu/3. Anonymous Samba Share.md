# 📂 Anonymous Samba Share  
**Setup Anonymous Samba Share on Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian**

Anonymous or guest shares allow users to access shared directories without authentication. This setup is useful for public access within a trusted network.

---

## 📁 Prepare Public Directory

Create a public directory with full access permissions:
```bash
 mkdir /Public
```

Set open permissions for read, write, and execute access:
```bash
 chmod 777 /Public/
```

Or recursively apply to all contents inside:
```bash
 chmod -R 777 /Public/
```

Verify the directory exists and has correct permissions:
```bash
ls -lh / | grep Public
```

Set ownership to the `nobody` user and group:
```bash
 chown -R nobody:nogroup /Public/
```

> 🔸 Note: On Debian-based systems, the default group for the `nobody` user is usually `nogroup`.

---

## ⚙️ Configure Samba for Anonymous Access

Edit the Samba configuration file:
```bash
 nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Append or modify the following share definition:

```ini
[Public]
path = /Public
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = no
create mode = 0777
directory mode = 0777
force user = nobody
```

### This configuration:
- Enables **guest-only** access
- Allows full **read/write/delete** capabilities
- Forces all operations as the `nobody` user

---

### 🔁 Restart Samba Service

Apply the configuration by restarting Samba:
```bash
 systemctl restart smbd
```

---

## 🧪 Test Anonymous Share Access

**Check the list of available shares on the Samba server:**
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145
```

**Try accessing the public share anonymously:**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.112.150/Public/
```

**Explicitly use guest access with no credentials:**
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145 -U "" -N
```

**Or connect directly to the public share as a guest:**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.112.145/Public -U "" -N
```

**Another equivalent form:**
```bash
smbclient -U "" //192.168.112.145/Public -N
```

---

## 🔧 Additional Sample Configuration

Here's an extended `smb.conf` snippet with additional shares:

### Create Directories:
```bash
 mkdir /opt/data
```
```bash
 mkdir /backup
```

### Edit Configuration File:
```bash
 nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

```ini
[data]
comment = Data
path = /opt/data
writable = yes

[backup]
comment = Server Backup
path = /backup
writable = yes
valid users = smb-user1, armour

[Public]
comment = Guest Share
path = /Public
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = no
create mode = 0777
directory mode = 0777
force user = nobody
```

**Ensure `/opt/data` and `/backup` exist and are accessible by intended users:**
```bash
 chown -R smb-user1: /opt/data
```
```bash
 chown -R armour: /backup
```

Restart Samba after any configuration changes:
```bash
 systemctl restart smbd
```

## ⚠️ Security Note

Anonymous shares should **only** be used in **trusted networks**.  
Avoid enabling guest access on **internet-facing systems** or in environments where **data sensitivity** is a concern.
