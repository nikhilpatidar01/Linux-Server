# 🔐 Share With Selected Users  
**Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian Setup**

This setup enables **controlled access** to the Samba share (`backup`) by specifying selected users.

---

## 1️⃣ Configure Samba Share for Selected Users

Edit the Samba configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add or update the configuration:

```ini
[global]
workgroup = SAMBA
security = user
passdb backend = tdbsam

printing = cups
printcap name = cups
load printers = yes
cups options = raw

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
valid users = %S, %D%w%S%
browseable = no
read only = no
inherit acls = yes

[printers]
comment = All Printers
path = /var/tmp
printable = yes
create mask = 0600
browseable = no

[print$]
comment = Printer Drivers
path = /var/lib/samba/drivers
write list = @printadmin, root
force group = @printadmin
create mask = 0664
directory mask = 0775

[data]
comment = Data
path = /opt/data
public = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = no
guest only = no

[backup]
comment = Server Backup
path = /backup
public = yes
writable = yes
valid users = nikhil, armour
```

> ✅ `valid users` restricts access to **only `nikhil` and `armour`** for the `backup` share.

---

## 🔁 Restart Samba Service

Apply the configuration changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

---

## 2️⃣ Access the Restricted Share

**Access as a user not listed (should be denied):**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.112.145/backup -U smb-user1
```

**Access as allowed users:**
```bash
smbclient -L //192.168.112.145 -U nikhil
```
```bash
smbclient -L //192.168.112.145 -U armour
```

---

## 🔧 Additional Notes

- Make sure `nikhil` and `armour` exist as both:
  - **Linux system users**
  - **Samba users**

Add them to Samba:
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a nikhil
```
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a armour
```

---

## 📁 Set Directory Permissions

Ensure the shared directory exists and has appropriate permissions:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /backup
```
```bash
sudo chmod -R 770 /backup
```
```bash
sudo chown root:users /backup
```

> 💡 You can also create a custom group (e.g., `sambashare`) and add both users to manage access more easily:
```bash
sudo groupadd sambashare
```
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sambashare nikhil
```
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sambashare armour
```
```bash
sudo chown root:sambashare /backup
