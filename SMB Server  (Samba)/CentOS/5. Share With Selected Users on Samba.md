# Share With Selected Users

This setup enables **controlled access** to the Samba share (`backup`) by specifying selected users.

---

## 1. Configure Samba Share for Selected Users

Edit the Samba configuration file:
```bash
vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add or modify the following configuration:

```ini
[global]
workgroup = SAMBA
security = user
passdb backend = tdbsam

printing = cups
printcap name = cups
load printers = yes
cups options = raw

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
valid users = %S, %D%w%S%
browseable = no
read only = no
inherit acls = yes

[printers]
comment = All Printers
path = /var/tmp
printable = yes
create mask = 0600
browseable = no

[print$]
comment = Printer Drivers
path = /var/lib/samba/drivers
write list = @printadmin, root
force group = @printadmin
create mask = 0664
directory mask = 0775

[data]
comment = Data
path = /opt/data
public = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = no
guest only = no

[backup]
comment = Server Backup
path = /backup
public = yes
writable = yes
valid users = nikhil, armour
```

> The `valid users` directive ensures **only `nikhil` and `armour`** can access the `backup` share.

---

## Restart Samba Service

Apply the configuration changes:
```bash
systemctl restart smb.service
```

---

## 2. Access the Restricted Share

**Access as a user not listed (should be denied):**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.112.145/backup -U smb-user1
```

**Access as allowed users:**
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145 -U nikhil
```
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145 -U armour
```

---

## Additional Notes

- Make sure the users (`nikhil`, `armour`) exist as both **Linux system users** and **Samba users**.
- Add Samba users with:
  ```bash
  smbpasswd -a nikhil
  ```
  ```bash
  smbpasswd -a armour
  ```

- Ensure the shared directory `/backup` has proper ownership and permissions:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /backup
  ```
  ```bash
  chmod -R 770 /backup
  ```
  ```bash
  chown root:users /backup
  ```

> You can also create a custom group (e.g., `sambashare`) and add `nikhil` and `armour` to it for easier permission management.
