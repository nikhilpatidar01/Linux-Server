# Anonymous Samba Share  
**Setup Anonymous Samba Share on RHEL/CentOS**

Anonymous or guest shares allow users to access shared directories without authentication. This setup is useful for public access within a trusted network.

---

## Prepare Public Directory

Create a public directory with full access permissions:
```bash
mkdir /Public
```

Set open permissions for read, write, and execute access:
```bash
chmod 777 /Public/
```

Or recursively apply to all contents inside:
```bash
chmod -R 777 /Public/
```

Verify the directory exists and has correct permissions:
```bash
ls -lh / | grep Public
```

Set ownership to the `nobody` user and group:
```bash
chown -R nobody:nobody /Public/
```

---

## Configure Samba for Anonymous Access

Edit the Samba configuration file:
```bash
nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Append or modify the following share definition:

```ini
[Public]
path = /Public
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = no
create mode = 0777
directory mode = 0777
force user = nobody
```

### This configuration:
- Enables **guest-only** access
- Allows full **read/write/delete** capabilities
- Forces all operations as the `nobody` user

---

### Restart Samba Service

Apply the configuration by restarting the Samba service:
```bash
systemctl restart smb.service
```

---

## Test Anonymous Share Access

**Check the list of available shares on the Samba server:**
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145
```

**Try accessing the public share anonymously:**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.25/Public/
```

**Explicitly use guest access with no credentials:**
```bash
smbclient -L 192.168.112.145 -U "" -N
```

**Or connect directly to the public share as a guest:**
```bash
smbclient //192.168.112.145/Public -U "" -N
```

**Another equivalent form:**
```bash
smbclient -U "" //192.168.1.27/Public -N
```

---

## Additional Sample Configuration

Here's an extended `smb.conf` snippet with additional shares:

### Create Directories:
```bash
mkdir /opt/data
mkdir /backup
```

### Edit Configuration File:
```bash
nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

```ini
[data]
comment = Data
path = /opt/data
writable = yes

[backup]
comment = Server Backup
path = /backup
writable = yes
valid users = smb-user1, armour

[Public]
path = /Public
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = no
create mode = 0777
directory mode = 0777
force user = nobody
```

**Make sure the directories `/opt/data` and `/backup` exist with proper ownership and permissions for listed users.**

Restart Samba after changes:
```bash
systemctl restart smb.service
```

---

## Security Note

Anonymous shares should **only** be used in **trusted networks**.  
Avoid enabling guest access on **internet-facing systems** or in environments where **data sensitivity** is a concern.
