### 🐱 `cat` Command in Linux  

The `cat` (concatenate) command is used to **view, create, and concatenate files** in Linux. It is one of the most commonly used commands for working with text files.

## 📌 Basic Syntax  
```bash
cat [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
```

---

## 🔹 Common Uses of `cat`  

### 1️⃣ Display the Contents of a File  
```bash
cat file.txt
```
🔹 This prints the content of `file.txt` to the terminal.  

### 2️⃣ View Multiple Files  
```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```
🔹 This concatenates and displays both files.  

### 3️⃣ Create a New File & Write to It  
```bash
cat > newfile.txt
```
🔹 This allows you to type text into `newfile.txt`.  
🔹 **Press `Ctrl + D` to save and exit.**  

### 4️⃣ Append Text to a File  
```bash
cat >> existingfile.txt
```
🔹 This appends new content to `existingfile.txt`.  
🔹 **Press `Ctrl + D` to save and exit.**  

### 5️⃣ Copy Contents from One File to Another  
```bash
cat file1.txt > file2.txt
```
🔹 This **overwrites** `file2.txt` with the content of `file1.txt`.  

### 6️⃣ Merge Multiple Files into One  
```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt > merged.txt
```
🔹 This combines `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into `merged.txt`.  

### 7️⃣ Show Line Numbers  
```bash
cat -n file.txt
```
🔹 This displays the file with **line numbers**.  

### 8️⃣ Remove Extra Blank Lines  
```bash
cat -s file.txt
```
🔹 This suppresses **consecutive empty lines**.  

### 9️⃣ Display File with `less` (For Large Files)  
```bash
cat largefile.txt | less
```
🔹 This allows **scrolling** through the file using `less`.  

### 🔟 Display File in Reverse Order  
```bash
tac file.txt
```
🔹 `tac` is like `cat`, but **displays lines in reverse order**.

## 🎯 Practical Examples  

🔹 **Combine all `.log` files into one file**  
```bash
cat *.log > all_logs.txt
```

🔹 **Check the contents of a system log file**  
```bash
cat /var/log/syslog | grep "error"
```

🔹 **Copy a file while keeping permissions intact**  
```bash
cat source.txt | tee destination.txt
```
