#### Understanding Default Permissions and Umask

**Umask** (user file-creation mode mask) is a critical setting in Unix-like operating systems that determines the default permissions for newly created files and directories. It effectively "masks" certain permissions, preventing them from being set when a file or directory is created.

### Default File Permission Calculation

1. **Default Permission (before umask)**:
   - Files: **rw-rw-rw-** (666)

2. **Applying umask**:
   - Umask: **022**
   - Calculation: 
     - Default (666) - Umask (022) = Resulting permission (644)

3. **Calculation for each bit**:
   - Owner: **rw-** (6)
   - Group: **r--** (4)
   - Others: **r--** (4)

**Resulting File Permission**: **rw-r--r--** (644).

### Default Directory Permission Calculation

1. **Default Permission (before umask)**:
   - Directories: **rwxrwxrwx** (777)

2. **Applying umask**:
   - Umask: **022**
   - Calculation:
     - Default (777) - Umask (022) = Resulting permission (755)

3. **Calculation for each bit**:
   - Owner: **rwx** (7)
   - Group: **r-x** (5)
   - Others: **r-x** (5)

**Resulting Directory Permission**: **rwxr-xr-x** (755).

### Chown Command Usage

The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of files and directories. You can change both the owner and group simultaneously and use wildcards for multiple files. Here are some examples:

- Change owner to `nikhil` for a file named `demo`:
  ```
  chown nikhil demo
  ```

- Change owner to `root` for a file named `log/messages`:
  ```
  chown root log/messages
  ```

- Recursively change owner to `nikhil` for all files in the `log/` directory:
  ```
  chown -R nikhil log/
  ```

- Change owner to `nikhil` for all files with the `.old` extension:
  ```
  chown nikhil *.old
  ```

- Change owner and group to `nikhil` for the `log/` directory:
  ```
  chown nikhil:nikhil log/
  ```

- Recursively change group to `nikhil` for all files in the `log/` directory:
  ```
  chown -R :nikhil log/
  ```

These commands illustrate the flexibility of `chown` in managing file ownership in a Linux environment.
