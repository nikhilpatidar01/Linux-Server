### Basic `su` Command

The `su` (substitute user) command is used to switch to another user account in a Linux environment. By default, it switches to the root user if no username is specified. Hereâ€™s how to use it with the username `nikhil`.

#### Basic Usage
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  (You will be prompted for nikhil's password)
  ```
  After entering the correct password, you will switch to the user `nikhil`, and the shell prompt will change to indicate that you are now logged in as `nikhil`.

### Explanation of Options with Input and Output

#### 1. `-c` or `--command=COMMAND`
- **Description:** Pass a command to the invoked shell to be executed as the target user.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -c 'whoami' nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  nikhil
  ```
  This command switches to user `nikhil` and executes `whoami`, which returns the username of the current user.

#### 2. `-m` or `-p` (Preserve Environment)
- **Description:** Do not reset environment variables when switching users.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  export MY_VAR="Hello"
  su -m nikhil -c 'echo $MY_VAR'
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  Hello
  ```
  This command preserves the environment variable `MY_VAR` when switching to `nikhil`, allowing it to be accessed.

#### 3. `-s` or `--shell=SHELL`
- **Description:** Use a specified shell instead of the default shell for the target user.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -s /bin/bash nikhil
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  (You will be switched to nikhil's bash shell)
  ```
  This command switches to `nikhil` using `/bin/bash` as the shell.

#### 4. `-l` or `--login`
- **Description:** Make the shell a login shell, which loads the user's environment as if they logged in directly.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -l nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  (You will be switched to nikhil's login shell)
  ```
  This command switches to `nikhil` and loads their environment settings.

#### 5. `-h` or `--help`
- **Description:** Display help information about the `su` command.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su --help
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  Usage: su [OPTION]... [USER] [ARGUMENTS]
  Switch to another user account.
  
  Options:
    -c, --command=COMMAND   pass COMMAND to the invoked shell
    -m, --preserve-environment  do not reset environment variables
    -p, --preserve-environment  same as -m
    -s, --shell=SHELL       use SHELL instead of the default
    -l, --login             make the shell a login shell
    -h, --help              display this help message and exit
    -V, --version           output version information and exit
  ```
  This command provides a summary of how to use `su` and its options.

#### 6. `-V` or `--version`
- **Description:** Output version information for the `su` command.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su --version
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  su (util-linux 2.36) 
  ```
  This command displays the version of the `su` command installed on the system.

### Summary

The `su` command is essential for switching users and executing commands with different user privileges in a Linux environment. Understanding its options allows for greater flexibility in managing user sessions and executing commands effectively.
