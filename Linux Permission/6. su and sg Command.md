### Basic `su` Command

The `su` (substitute user) command is used to switch to another user account in a Linux environment. By default, it switches to the root user if no username is specified. Hereâ€™s how to use it with the username `nikhil`.

#### Basic Usage
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  (You will be prompted for nikhil's password)
  ```
  After entering the correct password, you will switch to the user `nikhil`, and the shell prompt will change to indicate that you are now logged in as `nikhil`.

### Explanation of Options with Input and Output

#### 1. `-c` or `--command=COMMAND`
- **Description:** Pass a command to the invoked shell to be executed as the target user.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -c 'whoami' nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  nikhil
  ```
  This command switches to user `nikhil` and executes `whoami`, which returns the username of the current user.

#### 2. `-m` or `-p` (Preserve Environment)
- **Description:** Do not reset environment variables when switching users.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  export MY_VAR="Hello"
  su -m nikhil -c 'echo $MY_VAR'
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  Hello
  ```
  This command preserves the environment variable `MY_VAR` when switching to `nikhil`, allowing it to be accessed.

#### 3. `-s` or `--shell=SHELL`
- **Description:** Use a specified shell instead of the default shell for the target user.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -s /bin/bash nikhil
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  (You will be switched to nikhil's bash shell)
  ```
  This command switches to `nikhil` using `/bin/bash` as the shell.

#### 4. `-l` or `--login`
- **Description:** Make the shell a login shell, which loads the user's environment as if they logged in directly.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su -l nikhil
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  (You will be switched to nikhil's login shell)
  ```
  This command switches to `nikhil` and loads their environment settings.

#### 5. `-h` or `--help`
- **Description:** Display help information about the `su` command.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su --help
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  Usage: su [OPTION]... [USER] [ARGUMENTS]
  Switch to another user account.
  
  Options:
    -c, --command=COMMAND   pass COMMAND to the invoked shell
    -m, --preserve-environment  do not reset environment variables
    -p, --preserve-environment  same as -m
    -s, --shell=SHELL       use SHELL instead of the default
    -l, --login             make the shell a login shell
    -h, --help              display this help message and exit
    -V, --version           output version information and exit
  ```
  This command provides a summary of how to use `su` and its options.

#### 6. `-V` or `--version`
- **Description:** Output version information for the `su` command.
- **Input Example:**
  ```bash
  su --version
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  su (util-linux 2.36) 
  ```
  This command displays the version of the `su` command installed on the system.

### `su` Command: Basic Usage and Common Commands

The `su` command, which stands for "substitute user" or "switch user," is a fundamental command in Unix-like operating systems. It allows a user to switch to another user account, typically to gain superuser (root) privileges for administrative tasks.

#### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for the `su` command is:

```bash
su [options] [username]
```

- **`username`**: The name of the user you want to switch to. If omitted, it defaults to the root user.

### Commonly Used Options

1. **`-` or `--login`**: This option starts a login shell, which means it simulates a full login for the user, setting up the environment as if the user had logged in directly.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su - nikhil
     ```
   - This command switches to the user `nikhil` and loads their environment.

2. **`-c` or `--command=COMMAND`**: This option allows you to pass a command to be executed as the specified user.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su -c 'whoami' nikhil
     ```
   - This command runs `whoami` as the user `nikhil`, showing the username of the user executing the command.

3. **`-m` or `--preserve-environment`**: This option preserves the current environment variables when switching users.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su -m nikhil
     ```
   - This command switches to `nikhil` while keeping the current environment variables intact.

4. **`-s` or `--shell=SHELL`**: This option allows you to specify a different shell to use for the new user session.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su -s /bin/bash nikhil
     ```
   - This command switches to `nikhil` using the Bash shell.

5. **`-h` or `--help`**: Displays help information about the `su` command.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su --help
     ```
   - This command provides a summary of how to use `su` and its options.

6. **`-V` or `--version`**: Outputs version information for the `su` command.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     su --version
     ```
   - This command shows the version of the `su` command installed on the system.

### Example Usage Scenarios

#### 1. Switching to Root User
To switch to the root user and start a login shell:
```bash
su -
```
You will be prompted for the root password.

#### 2. Running a Command as Another User
To run a command as another user without switching to their shell:
```bash
su -c 'ls /home/nikhil' nikhil
```
This command lists the contents of `nikhil`'s home directory.

#### 3. Switching Users While Preserving Environment
To switch to a user while keeping the current environment:
```bash
su -m nikhil
```

### Summary

The `su` command is essential for switching users and executing commands with different user privileges in a Linux environment. Understanding its options allows for greater flexibility in managing user sessions and executing commands effectively.

### `sg` Command: Basic Usage

The `sg` command is a utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows you to execute commands with the privileges of a specified group. This can be particularly useful for running commands that require specific group permissions without needing to switch users entirely.

#### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for the `sg` command is as follows:

```bash
sg [groupname] -c 'command'
```

- **`groupname`**: The name of the group whose privileges you want to use.
- **`command`**: The command you want to execute.

### Examples of Using `sg`

#### 1. Running a Command with Group Privileges

**Input Example:**
```bash
sg developers -c 'whoami'
```

**Output:**
```
nikhil
```
In this example, the command `whoami` is executed with the privileges of the `developers` group. The output shows the username of the current user, but the command runs with the specified group privileges.

#### 2. Running a Multi-word Command

When executing commands that contain spaces, you need to enclose the command in quotes.

**Input Example:**
```bash
sg admin -c 'echo "Hello, World!"'
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```
This command runs `echo "Hello, World!"` with the privileges of the `admin` group.

#### 3. Checking Group Membership

You can also use `sg` to check if you have the necessary group privileges.

**Input Example:**
```bash
sg users -c 'groups'
```

**Output:**
```
nikhil : nikhil users
```
This command lists the groups that the user `nikhil` belongs to, executed with the privileges of the `users` group.

### Summary

The `sg` command is a powerful tool for executing commands with specific group privileges, allowing for greater control over permissions in a multi-user environment. By using the `-c` option, you can run any command as if you were a member of the specified group, making it easier to manage tasks that require elevated permissions.
