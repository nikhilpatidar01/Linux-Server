   - Click "Next".

## Step 3: Allocate Memory

- **Memory Size**: Allocate at least 1 GB of RAM (2048 MB recommended for better performance).
- Click "Next".

## Step 4: Create a Virtual Hard Disk

1. **Select Hard Disk Option**: Choose "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create".
2. **Hard Disk File Type**: Select VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) and click "Next".
3. **Storage on Physical Hard Disk**: Choose "Dynamically allocated" and click "Next".
4. **File Location and Size**:
   - Set the size of the virtual hard disk (at least 20 GB recommended).
   - Click "Create".

## Step 5: Configure VM Settings

1. **Select VM**: Highlight your newly created VM and click on "Settings".
2. **Storage Settings**:
   - Go to the "Storage" section.
   - Under "Controller: IDE", click on the empty disk icon.
   - Click on the disk icon on the right side and select "Choose a disk file".
   - Locate and select the CentOS ISO file you downloaded earlier.

## Step 6: Boot from Installation Media

- Click "OK" to save settings, then click "Start" to boot the VM.
- When prompted, select "Install CentOS".

## Step 7: Language and Keyboard Selection

1. Choose your preferred language for installation and click "Continue".
2. Select your keyboard layout if necessary.

## Step 8: Disk Partitioning Setup

1. **Installation Summary**: Click on "Installation Destination".
2. **Select Disk**: Choose the virtual hard disk where you want to install CentOS.
3. **Partitioning Options**:
   - Select "I will configure partitioning" to create custom partitions.

## Step 9: Create Partitions

You will need to create three partitions: `/`, `swap`, and `/boot`.

1. **Create `/boot` Partition**:
   - Click on the "+" button to add a new partition.
   - **Mount Point**: `/boot`
   - **Size**: Allocate around 500 MB (recommended).
   - **File System**: Select `ext4`.
   - Click "Add".

2. **Create `/` (Root) Partition**:
   - Click on the "+" button again.
   - **Mount Point**: `/`
   - **Size**: Allocate space for your root filesystem (e.g., 20 GB or more depending on your needs).
   - **File System**: Select `ext4`.
   - Click "Add".

3. **Create `swap` Partition**:
   - Click on the "+" button once more.
   - **Mount Point**: Leave this blank (it will be recognized as swap).
   - **Size**: Allocate swap space (typically, this is equal to your RAM size, but at least 2 GB is recommended).
   - **File System**: Select `swap area`.
   - Click "Add".

## Step 10: Review and Write Changes

- Review your partition layout to ensure it meets your requirements.
- Click "Done" to write changes to disk.

## Step 11: Configure Network Settings

1. Go back to the Installation Summary screen.
2. Click on "Network & Hostname".
3. Enable your network interface and set a hostname if desired.

## Step 12: Begin Installation

1. Go back to the Installation Summary screen.

## Step 13: Complete Installation

- Once the installation is complete, reboot the system when prompted.
- Remove the installation media when instructed.

## Step 14: Verify Partitions

After rebooting into CentOS, you can verify that your partitions are correctly set up by running:

```bash
df -h
swapon --show
```

This will display the mounted filesystems and confirm that your swap space is active.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed CentOS in VirtualBox with separate partitions for `/`, `swap`, and `/boot`. This setup helps in managing system resources efficiently and improves performance during operations like booting and memory management.
