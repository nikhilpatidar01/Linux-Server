# 🖥️ Remote Shell in Linux

A remote shell allows users to access and execute commands on a remote Linux system from their local machine. This is typically achieved using SSH (Secure Shell), which provides secure encrypted connections. 🔐

## 🌐 How to Connect and Disconnect from a Remote Shell

### ✅ **Connecting to a Remote Linux System**
To establish a connection with a remote Linux server, use the SSH command:
```bash
ssh username@remote_server_ip
```
**Example:**
```bash
ssh nikhil@192.168.1.100
```
- If connecting for the first time, type `yes` when prompted to verify the server's authenticity. 🔑
- Enter the password when prompted.
- Once authenticated, you will have access to the remote shell. 🏁

### 🚀 **Running a Single Command on a Remote Server**
To execute a single command on the remote server without opening an interactive session:
```bash
ssh username@remote_server_ip 'command'
```
**Example:**
```bash
ssh nikhil@192.168.1.100 'ls -l /var/www'
```

### 📤 **Transferring Files Using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**
#### 📂 **Copying Files to a Remote Server**
```bash
scp /path/to/local/file username@remote_server_ip:/path/to/remote/destination
```
**Example:**
```bash
scp myfile.txt nikhil@192.168.1.100:/home/nikhil/
```

#### 📥 **Copying Files from a Remote Server to Local System**
```bash
scp username@remote_server_ip:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination
```
**Example:**
```bash
scp nikhil@192.168.1.100:/home/nikhil/myfile.txt ./
```

### ❌ **Disconnecting from a Remote Shell**
Once you are done with the remote session, disconnect using one of the following commands:
```bash
exit
```
or
```bash
logout
```
or use the keyboard shortcut:
```
Ctrl + D
```

🔚 Happy Remote Access! 🎯
