# Allow Root Login on vsftpd (FTP Server)

By default, **vsftpd** denies FTP access to privileged users like root for security reasons. However, in certain controlled environments (e.g., labs, VMs), you might want to enable root FTP login.

> **Warning**: Allowing root to log in via FTP is a major security risk and should never be done on a production or internet-facing server. Proceed only in isolated, secure environments.

---

## 1. Edit the `/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers` File

This file lists users who are always denied FTP access, even if they have a valid shell and password. To allow root login, you need to remove or comment out the `root` entry.

To edit the file, run:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers
```

### **Original version** (root is blocked):

```text
# Users that are not allowed to login via FTP
root
bin
daemon
adm
lp
sync
shutdown
halt
mail
news
uucp
operator
games
nobody
```

### **Updated version** (root is allowed):

```text
# vsftpd userlist
# If user_list_enable=YES (default), never allow users in this file, and not even prompt for a password.
# Note that the default vsftpd checks /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers

#root
bin
daemon
adm
lp
sync
shutdown
halt
news
uucp
operator
games
nobody
```

By commenting out `root`, the `root` user will no longer be blocked by **vsftpd**.

## 2. Restart the vsftpd Service

After making changes, restart the **vsftpd** service to apply them:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
```

Check its status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
```

---

## 3. Optional: Verify Root Shell and Password

Ensure that the **root** account has a valid login shell and password. Check the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
grep root /etc/passwd
```

**Expected output**:

```text
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

If the root account does not have a valid shell or password, you can set or reset the root password:

```bash
sudo passwd root
```

---

## 4. Test Root FTP Login

Now you can attempt to log in via FTP using **root**:

```bash
ftp 192.168.1.50
```

**Credentials**:

- **Username**: root
- **Password**: [your root password]

If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to log in as root.

---

## 5. Additional Notes

- **vsftpd.conf** settings related to user access do not need modification if `local_enable=YES` is already set. This option enables local user login, including root if not blocked.
  
- For secure setups, it is recommended to:
  - Use **SSH/SFTP** instead of FTP.
  - Use **virtual users** with limited access if FTP is required, which adds an additional layer of security.

> **Note**: Allowing root access via FTP is a major security risk. Only use this setup in isolated and controlled environments. For production systems, use SSH/SFTP for secure remote file transfers.
