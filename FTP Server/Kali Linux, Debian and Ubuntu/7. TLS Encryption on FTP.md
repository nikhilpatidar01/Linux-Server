# TLS Encryption on FTP

To enable **TLS encryption** on **vsftpd**, follow the steps below to secure FTP connections with SSL/TLS.

---

## Step 1: Create the Required Directories (If Missing)

First, ensure the necessary directories for SSL certificates are created:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs
```

---

## Step 2: Generate the TLS Certificate & Key

Generate a self-signed TLS certificate and key with the following command:

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
-newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key \
-out /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
```

This will create the TLS certificate and key for **vsftpd**.

---

## Step 3: Set the Correct File Permissions

Ensure the correct permissions are set on the certificate and key files:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
```

---

## Step 4: Update the vsftpd Configuration

Edit the **vsftpd** configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
```

Add the following TLS-related configuration options:

```ini
# ================================
# TLS CONFIGURATION
# ================================
ssl_enable=YES
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
```

Make sure the paths and filenames are correct.

---

## Step 5: Restart the FTP Service

Apply the new TLS settings by restarting the **vsftpd** service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
```

---

## Step 6: Test the TLS Setup with FTP Clients

You can now test the TLS encryption with FTP clients like **FileZilla**, **FTP command-line client**, or any other FTP client that supports TLS.

### Example for FileZilla:
1. Open **FileZilla**.
2. Go to **File > Site Manager**.
3. Select your server or create a new one.
4. Under the **Encryption** dropdown, select **Require explicit FTP over TLS**.
5. Enter your server's IP address and port.
6. Log in using your credentials (username and password).

You should now be securely connected using TLS encryption.

---

## Example of /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/ftpuser1

To restrict FTP users to specific directories (jail them), you can create user-specific configuration files. For example, for **ftpuser1**, add the following line to their configuration:

```ini
local_root=/backup/ftpuser1
```

Repeat this for each user with their corresponding folder.

---

## Example of /etc/vsftpd/allow_users

To specify which users are allowed to log in to the FTP server, you can add them to the **allow_users** file. Add each username on a new line:

```ini
ftpuser1
ftpuser2
adminftp
```

Make sure that these usernames are not blocked in **/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers** or **/etc/vsftpd/user_list**, as they would be denied access even if listed in the **allow_users** file.

---

## Step 7: Test FTP Login

### Create Local Users (If Not Already Created)

If the users are not created already, use the following command to add them:

```bash
sudo adduser ftpuser1
sudo adduser ftpuser2
```

### Add Users to the Allow List

Make sure the users are added to the **allow_users** list:

```bash
echo "ftpuser1" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd/allow_users
echo "ftpuser2" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd/allow_users
```

### Attempt FTP Login

Use any FTP client (like **FileZilla** or **FTP command-line client**) to attempt logging in with one of the allowed users.

#### Example using FTP command-line client:

```bash
ftp <your-server-ip>
```

Login as **ftpuser1**:

```bash
Username: ftpuser1
Password: <your-password>
```

#### Expected Outcome:

- If the login is successful, you will be placed in the directory configured for that user (e.g., `/backup/ftpuser1`).
- If the user is not in the allowed list, they will be denied access.

---

## Additional Notes:

- Make sure the **ftpusers** and **user_list** files do not block the allowed users.
- If a user appears in **/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers** or **/etc/vsftpd/user_list**, they will be blocked from logging in even if they are listed in **allow_users**.
- To avoid this, you may need to comment out or remove those users from the **ftpusers** and **user_list** files.
- **TLS** encryption is recommended for secure connections over FTP, as it protects the credentials and data from being transmitted in plain text.
