# Allow Root Login on vsftpd (FTP Server)

By default, **vsftpd** denies FTP access to privileged users like root for security reasons. However, in certain controlled environments (e.g., labs, VMs), you might want to enable root FTP login.

**Warning**: Allowing root to log in via FTP is a major security risk and should never be done on a production or internet-facing server. Proceed only in isolated, secure environments.

---

## 1. Edit the `/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers` File

This file lists users who are always denied FTP access, even if they have a valid shell and password. You must remove or comment out the `root` entry.

To edit the file, use:

```bash
nano /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers
```

**Original example** (root is blocked):

```text
# Users that are not allowed to login via FTP
root
bin
daemon
adm
lp
sync
shutdown
halt
mail
news
uucp
operator
games
nobody
```

**Updated version**:

```text
# vsftpd userlist
# If user_list_enable=YES (default), never allow users in this file, and not even prompt for a password.
# Note that the default vsftpd checks /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers

#root
bin
daemon
adm
lp
sync
shutdown
halt
news
uucp
operator
games
nobody
```


## 2. Restart the vsftpd Service

After making changes, restart the **vsftpd** service to apply them:

```bash
systemctl restart vsftpd.service
```

Check its status:

```bash
systemctl status vsftpd.service
```


## 3. Optional: Verify Root Shell and Password

Make sure that the **root** account has a valid login shell and password. Check the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
grep root /etc/passwd
```

**Expected output**:

```text
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

To set (or reset) the root password:

```bash
passwd root
```


## 4. Test Root FTP Login

You can now attempt to log in via FTP using **root**:

```bash
ftp 192.168.1.50
```

**Credentials**:

- **Username**: root
- **Password**: [your root password]


## 5. Additional Notes

- **vsftpd.conf** settings related to user access do not need modification if `local_enable=YES` is already set.
- For secure setups, it is recommended to:
  - Use **SSH/SFTP** instead of FTP.
  - Use **virtual users** with limited access if FTP is required.
