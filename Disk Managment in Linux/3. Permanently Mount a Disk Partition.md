To **permanently mount a disk partition** in Linux, you need to follow a series of steps that will configure the system to automatically mount the partition during boot. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### **Step 1: Identify the Disk Partition**

Before mounting a disk partition, you need to identify the disk and partition you want to mount. You can use the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command to list the available disks and partitions.

#### Command:
```bash
# lsblk
```

**Example Output:**
```plaintext
NAME        MAJ:MIN  RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0   100G  0 disk 
├─sda1        8:1    0    50G  0 part /mnt/data
├─sda2        8:2    0    50G  0 part
```

In this example, we have a disk `sda` with two partitions: `sda1` (mounted at `/mnt/data`) and `sda2` (not mounted).

### **Step 2: Create a Mount Point**

A mount point is a directory where the partition will be mounted. Typically, mount points are created in the `/mnt` or `/media` directory, but you can create any directory.

#### Command:
```bash
# mkdir /mnt/mydata
```

This creates a new directory `/mnt/mydata` where we will mount the partition.

### **Step 3: Mount the Partition Temporarily**

Before adding the entry to `/etc/fstab` for permanent mounting, let's mount the partition temporarily to verify everything works.

#### Command:
```bash
# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/mydata
```

This mounts the partition `/dev/sda2` to `/mnt/mydata`.

#### Verify the Mount:
To verify the partition is mounted, use the `df -h` command.

#### Command:
```bash
# df -h
```

**Example Output:**
```plaintext
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G  10G   40G  20% /mnt/data
/dev/sda2        50G  2G   48G   5% /mnt/mydata
```

As you can see, `/dev/sda2` is now mounted at `/mnt/mydata`.

### **Step 4: Make the Mount Permanent (Edit `/etc/fstab`)**

To ensure that the partition is mounted automatically during boot, you need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains a list of disk partitions and their associated mount points.

#### Command:
```bash
# vim /etc/fstab
```

**Example `/etc/fstab` entry:**
```plaintext
/dev/sda2       /mnt/mydata   ext4    defaults    0 0
```

This entry tells the system to mount the partition `/dev/sda2` at `/mnt/mydata` with the `ext4` file system using default mount options during system startup.

#### Explanation of `/etc/fstab` columns:
1. **/dev/sda2**: The disk partition you want to mount.
2. **/mnt/mydata**: The mount point (directory where the partition will be mounted).
3. **ext4**: The file system type (use the correct type for your partition, like `ext4`, `xfs`, etc.).
4. **defaults**: Mount options. `defaults` is commonly used for standard mounting.
5. **0**: Used for filesystem backup; set to `0` if you don’t need it.
6. **0**: Used by fsck for checking the file system during boot; set to `0` if you don't want the system to check this partition.

### **Step 5: Verify `/etc/fstab` Entry**

To make sure there are no mistakes in the `/etc/fstab` file, you can run the following command to check for syntax errors:

#### Command:
```bash
# mount -a
```

If there are no errors, the command will run silently and the partition will be mounted as specified in `/etc/fstab`.

### **Step 6: Reboot the System**

Now that the entry is added to `/etc/fstab`, you can reboot the system to ensure the partition is automatically mounted on boot.

#### Command:
```bash
# reboot
```

After the system reboots, the partition `/dev/sda2` should be automatically mounted to `/mnt/mydata`.

### **Step 7: Verify After Reboot**

After the system boots up, verify that the partition is mounted correctly.

#### Command:
```bash
# df -h
```

**Example Output:**
```plaintext
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G  10G   40G  20% /mnt/data
/dev/sda2        50G  2G   48G   5% /mnt/mydata
```

The partition `/dev/sda2` is mounted at `/mnt/mydata`, confirming that the mount is now permanent.

### Summary of Steps:

1. **Identify the Partition**: Use `lsblk` to find the partition you want to mount.
2. **Create a Mount Point**: Use `mkdir` to create a directory where the partition will be mounted.
3. **Mount the Partition Temporarily**: Use `mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/mydata` to mount it temporarily.
4. **Edit `/etc/fstab`**: Add an entry for the partition in `/etc/fstab` to make the mount permanent.
5. **Verify the `/etc/fstab` Entry**: Run `mount -a` to check for errors.
6. **Reboot the System**: Reboot the system to make the mount persistent across reboots.
7. **Verify After Reboot**: Use `df -h` to confirm the partition is mounted at boot.

By following these steps, the partition will be mounted automatically whenever the system is rebooted, ensuring that your disk partition is permanently mounted at the specified mount point.
