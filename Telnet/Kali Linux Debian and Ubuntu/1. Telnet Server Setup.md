# Telnet Server Setup on Kali Linux / Debian / Ubuntu
TELNET is a type of protocol that enables one computer to connect to the local computer. It is used as a standard TCP/IP protocol for virtual terminal service which is provided by ISO. The computer which starts the connection is known as the local computer. The computer which is being connected to i.e. which accepts the connection known as the remote computer. During telnet operation, whatever is being performed on the remote computer will be displayed by the local computer. Telnet operates on a client/server principle.

## Install Telnet Packages

### Update package list:
```bash
 apt update
```

### Install Telnet client and server:
```bash
 apt install telnetd telnet
```

### Install `xinetd` (if planning to use it):
```bash
 apt install xinetd
```

---

## Inspect Installed Packages

### Get detailed information about the Telnet server:
```bash
apt show telnetd
```

### List files installed by the Telnet server:
```bash
dpkg -L telnetd
```

### List documentation files related to the Telnet server:
```bash
ls /usr/share/doc/telnetd/
```

### List configuration files (typically `/etc/inetd.conf` or related):
```bash
 find /etc -name "*telnet*"
```

### Similarly, for `xinetd`:
```bash
apt show xinetd
dpkg -L xinetd
ls /usr/share/doc/xinetd/
```

---

## Configure Systemd (Native Method)

This method uses systemd to manage Telnet service **without relying on xinetd**.

### Create Telnet Socket Unit

Create or edit the Telnet socket unit file:
```bash
 vim /etc/systemd/system/telnet.socket
```

Insert:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telnet Server Activation Socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=23
Accept=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

---

### Create Telnet Service Unit

Create the Telnet service file:
```bash
 vim /etc/systemd/system/telnet@.service
```

Insert:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telnet Server Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.telnetd
StandardInput=socket
```

---

### Enable and Start Telnet Socket

Enable at boot:
```bash
 systemctl enable telnet.socket
```

Start immediately:
```bash
 systemctl start telnet.socket
```

---

## Configure UFW Firewall

### Allow Port 23/TCP
```bash
 ufw allow 23/tcp
```

### Reload UFW to apply changes:
```bash
 ufw reload
```

### Check allowed ports:
```bash
 ufw status
```

Expected output:
```
23/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere
```

---

## Verify Service Status

Check if Telnet is listening on port 23:
```bash
 netstat -nltup | grep 23
```
Or use:
```bash
 ss -tuln | grep 23
```

Test connection from a client machine:
```bash
telnet 192.168.95.145
```

---

## Enable Root Login via Telnet (Optional and Risky)

By default, root login may be disabled over Telnet.

Edit the file:
```bash
 vim /etc/securetty
```

Add:
```
pts/0
pts/1
pts/2
pts/3
pts/4
pts/5
pts/6
pts/7
pts/8
pts/9
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Enabling root login over Telnet is **insecure**. Only do this for testing in **isolated environments**.

---

## üîí Important Security Warning

- Telnet sends data (including passwords) in **plain text**.
- Use **SSH** instead of Telnet for secure remote access.
- If using Telnet, **restrict access** to **trusted internal networks** only.
- Use **TCP wrappers**, **IP whitelisting**, or **fail2ban** for added protection.
