# Telnet Server Setup on CentOS/RHEL

TELNET is a type of protocol that enables one computer to connect to the local computer. It is used as a standard TCP/IP protocol for virtual terminal service which is provided by ISO. The computer which starts the connection is known as the local computer. The computer which is being connected to i.e. which accepts the connection known as the remote computer. During telnet operation, whatever is being performed on the remote computer will be displayed by the local computer. Telnet operates on a client/server principle.

## Install Telnet Packages

### Check if Telnet is already installed:
```bash
rpm -qa | grep telnet
```

### If Telnet is not installed, install it along with required components:
```bash
yum install telnet*
```

### Install specific Telnet server and client packages:
```bash
yum install telnet-server telnet
```

### Install `xinetd`, which acts as a super-server for Telnet:
```bash
yum install xinetd
```

### Verify installation:
```bash
rpm -qa | grep telnet
```

---

## Inspect Installed Packages

### Get detailed information about the Telnet server:
```bash
rpm -qi telnet-server
```

### List all files provided by the Telnet server package:
```bash
rpm -ql telnet-server
```

### List all documentation files related to the Telnet server:
```bash
rpm -qd telnet-server
```

### List configuration files associated with the Telnet server:
```bash
rpm -qc telnet-server
```

### Similarly, check information about xinetd:
```bash
rpm -qi xinetd
```

### List xinetd files:
```bash
rpm -ql xinetd
```

### List xinetd documentation files:
```bash
rpm -qd xinetd
```

### List xinetd configuration files:
```bash
rpm -qc xinetd
```

---

## Configure Systemd (Native Method)

This method directly manages Telnet through `systemd` without relying on `xinetd`.

### Create Telnet Socket Unit

Edit the Telnet socket unit file:
```bash
vim /etc/systemd/system/telnet.socket
```

Insert the following configuration:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telnet Server Activation Socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=23
Accept=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

---

### Create Telnet Service Unit

Create the Telnet service file:
```bash
vim /etc/systemd/system/telnet@.service
```

Insert the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telnet Server Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.telnetd
StandardInput=socket
```

---

### Enable and Start Telnet Socket

Enable the socket at boot time:
```bash
systemctl enable telnet.socket
```

Start the socket immediately:
```bash
systemctl start telnet.socket
```

---

## Configure Firewall

### Add Port 23/TCP Permanently
```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=23/tcp
```
Expected output:
```
success
```

### Reload Firewall Rules
```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```
Expected output:
```
success
```

### Verify Open Ports
```bash
firewall-cmd --list-ports
```
Example output:
```
23/tcp
```
If you see `23/tcp` in the output, the firewall rule has been successfully added.

---

## Verify Service Status

Check if Telnet is listening on port 23:
```bash
netstat -nltup | grep 23
```

Test connection from a client machine:
```bash
telnet 192.168.95.145
```

---

## Enable Root Login via Telnet (Optional and Risky)

By default, root login may be disabled over Telnet. To allow it, update the `securetty` file.

Edit the file:
```bash
vim /etc/securetty
```

Add the following lines:
```
pts/0
pts/1
pts/2
pts/3
pts/4
pts/5
pts/6
pts/7
pts/8
pts/9
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Allowing root login over Telnet is highly discouraged unless necessary for testing in a controlled environment.

## üîí Important Security Warning

- Telnet transmits data, including passwords, in **plain text**.
- It is **recommended to use SSH** instead of Telnet for secure remote access.
- If Telnet must be used, **restrict access to internal, trusted networks only**.
- Implement **additional security measures** such as **TCP Wrappers** or **IP address restrictions**.
