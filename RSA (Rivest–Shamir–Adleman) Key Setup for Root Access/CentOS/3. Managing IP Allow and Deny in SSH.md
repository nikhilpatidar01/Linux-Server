# 🔐 Managing IP Allow and Deny in SSH

SSH access to a Linux system can be controlled by specifying which users and IP addresses are **allowed** or **denied** using directives in the SSH daemon configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`). This is useful for tightening security, especially on critical systems.

---

## 🧾 Step 1: Open SSH Configuration File

Use a text editor like `vim` to open the SSH daemon configuration file:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

---

## 🚫 Step 2: Deny SSH Access From Specific Users or IPs

To block access from specific users or IP addresses, add `DenyUsers` directives.

```
DenyUsers root@192.168.95.150       
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.150          
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.*            
DenyUsers root@*                    
```

### 🔧 Example Configuration:

```bash
# Match specific user and apply restricted settings
Match User anoncvs
    X11Forwarding no
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    PermitTTY no
    ForceCommand cvs server

# Deny SSH login for these cases
DenyUsers root@192.168.95.150       # Deny root from this IP
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.150          # Deny any user from this specific IP
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.*            # Deny any user from IP range 192.168.95.x
DenyUsers root@*                    # Deny root login from all IPs
```

### 📝 Description:
- `root@192.168.95.150`: Denies root login from this specific IP.
- `*@192.168.95.150`: Denies any user from IP `192.168.95.150`.
- `*@192.168.95.*`: Denies any user from the entire `192.168.95.x` subnet.
- `root@*`: Denies root login from all IP addresses.

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Restart SSH Service

Apply the changes by restarting the SSH service:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Allow SSH Access From Specific Users or IPs

If you want to allow access only to specific users or IPs, use the `AllowUsers` directive.

### 🔧 Example Configuration:

```bash
AllowUsers nikhil@*
AllowUsers *@192.168.95.150
```

### 📝 Description:
- `nikhil@*`: Allows user `nikhil` from any IP.
- `*@192.168.95.150`: Allows any user from IP `192.168.95.150`.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If both `DenyUsers` and `AllowUsers` are used, `DenyUsers` always takes **precedence**.

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Restart SSH Service Again

After changes, restart the SSH service again:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- ✅ Always **test new SSH changes in a second terminal/session** before restarting the service.
- 🔍 Run `sshd -t` before restarting to check for syntax errors:
  ```bash
  sshd -t
  ```
- 🔒 Use `Match` blocks for advanced per-user, per-IP, or group-based restrictions.
- 🔥 Combine with firewall rules (`ufw`, `iptables`, etc.) for layered security.
- 👨‍💻 For root user login, also ensure `PermitRootLogin` is appropriately configured (`no`, `without-password`, etc.).
