# 🔐 Managing IP Allow and Deny in SSH (Kali Linux / Debian / Ubuntu)

You can control SSH access on Debian-based systems (Kali, Ubuntu) using directives in the SSH daemon configuration file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. This is useful for restricting access based on users and IP addresses.

---

## 🧾 Step 1: Open SSH Configuration File

Edit the SSH daemon configuration file using your preferred editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, or `gedit`):

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

---

## 🚫 Step 2: Deny SSH Access From Specific Users or IPs

To **deny access** from specific users or IP addresses, use the `DenyUsers` directive.

```text
DenyUsers root@192.168.95.150       
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.150          
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.*            
DenyUsers root@*                    
```

### 🔧 Example Configuration:

```text
# Match specific user and apply restricted settings
Match User anoncvs
    X11Forwarding no
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    PermitTTY no
    ForceCommand cvs server

# Deny SSH login for these users/IPs
DenyUsers root@192.168.95.150       # Deny root from this IP
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.150          # Deny any user from this specific IP
DenyUsers *@192.168.95.*            # Deny any user from subnet 192.168.95.x
DenyUsers root@*                    # Deny root login from all IPs
```

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Restart SSH Service

After modifying the configuration file, restart the SSH service to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

> ✅ On Debian-based systems (like Kali or Ubuntu), the service name is `ssh`, not `sshd`.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Allow SSH Access From Specific Users or IPs

To **allow access** only to specific users or IPs, use the `AllowUsers` directive:

### 🔧 Example Configuration:

```text
AllowUsers nikhil@*
AllowUsers *@192.168.95.150
```

### 📝 Description:
- `nikhil@*`: Allows user `nikhil` to connect from any IP.
- `*@192.168.95.150`: Allows any user from IP `192.168.95.150`.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If both `AllowUsers` and `DenyUsers` are defined, `DenyUsers` takes precedence.

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Restart SSH Service Again

Apply any new `AllowUsers` changes by restarting SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- ✅ Always **test your SSH configuration in a second terminal** before restarting, to avoid getting locked out.
- 🔍 Use the following command to **validate your SSH configuration** before restarting:
  ```bash
  sudo sshd -t
  ```
- 🔒 Use `Match` blocks to configure **advanced per-user or per-IP rules**.
- 🔥 Consider combining with firewall rules using `ufw` for additional security:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow from 192.168.95.150 to any port 22
  ```
- 👨‍💻 For managing root login access, also verify this setting:
  ```text
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```
