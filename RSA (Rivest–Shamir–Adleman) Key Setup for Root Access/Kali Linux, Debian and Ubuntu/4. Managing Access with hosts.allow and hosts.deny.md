# 🔐 Managing Access with `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` (TCP Wrappers)

On Debian-based systems (like Kali Linux and Ubuntu), you can restrict or allow access to network services using **TCP Wrappers** with the files:

- `/etc/hosts.allow`: Defines which hosts are **allowed** to connect.
- `/etc/hosts.deny`: Defines which hosts are **denied** access.

TCP Wrappers work only for services compiled with `libwrap`, such as `sshd`, `vsftpd`, `rpcbind`, etc.

## 🚫 Deny SSH Access to Specific Hosts

### 🔧 Step 1: Edit `/etc/hosts.deny`

Use any editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`) to configure denied hosts:

```bash
 vim /etc/hosts.deny
```

### 📂 Example Entries:

```text
# Deny rules for TCP Wrappers
# For more info: man hosts_access, man hosts_options

sshd : 192.168.95.150
sshd : 192.168.95.*
sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0
sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0 EXCEPT 192.168.95.150
```

### 📝 Explanation:
- `sshd : 192.168.95.150` — Deny SSH from this exact IP.
- `sshd : 192.168.95.*` — Deny SSH from all IPs in this range.
- `sshd : 192.168.95.0/255.255.255.0` — Deny SSH from full subnet.
- `EXCEPT` — Allow exceptions even within denied subnets.

## ✅ Allow SSH Access to Specific Hosts

### 🔁 Option: Deny All, Then Allow Specific Hosts

This is a **secure approach**: block everything by default, then explicitly allow known IPs.

---

### 🛑 Step 1: Block All in `/etc/hosts.deny`

```bash
 vim /etc/hosts.deny
```

Add:

```text
# Block all SSH access by default
sshd : ALL
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Allow Specific IP in `/etc/hosts.allow`

```bash
 vim /etc/hosts.allow
```

Add:

```text
# Allow SSH from a specific IP address
sshd : 192.168.95.150
```

## 🧠 Notes & Best Practices

- ⚠️ These rules **only apply to services** using **TCP Wrappers** (`libwrap`).
- 🔒 Combine with `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` rules like `AllowUsers`, `DenyUsers`, and `Match`.
- 🧪 Always test changes using a **second active SSH session** to avoid locking yourself out.
- 🔍 Use `man tcpd`, `man hosts_access`, and `man hosts_options` for more details.
- 🔥 For added protection, also configure a firewall (`ufw`, `iptables`, or `nftables`):
  ```bash
   ufw allow from 192.168.95.150 to any port 22
  ```
