# 🔑 SSH Keygen Usage and SSH Authentication Setup (Kali Linux / Debian / Ubuntu)

This guide explains how to generate SSH keys, set up public key authentication, apply secure permissions, and connect to remote servers using RSA or DSA keys — tailored for **Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Debian systems**.

---

### 1. **Generate a Basic SSH Key Pair** 🛠️

Generates an RSA key pair stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

---

### 2. **Generate an RSA Key Without a Passphrase** 🔓

Creates an RSA key for passwordless SSH logins.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -q -N ""
```

---

### 3. **Add the Public Key to Authorized Keys** 📜

Add the public key for local or remote SSH login:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

> ✅ Recommended over `cp` to avoid overwriting existing keys.

---

### 4. **Create a Custom Private Key File** 📝

Create a new custom key file and paste private key content into it.

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/id_rsa_custom
```

---

### 5. **Secure the Private Key File** 🔒

Make the private key readable only by the owner:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_custom
```

---

### 6. **SSH Into a Server Using a Custom Key** 🌐

Specify a custom private key file for login:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_custom username@192.168.95.145
```

---

### 7. **Generate RSA Keys with Various Options** 🔐

- **2048-bit RSA with a Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/id_rsa -q -N "nikhil123"
```

- **2048-bit RSA without a Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/id_rsa -q -N ""
```

- **Default Location with Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N "nikhil123"
```

- **Custom File + Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /tmp/id_rsa3 -q -N "nikhil123"
```

---

### 8. **Check the Type of Key File** 🧐

Verify if files are valid private/public keys:

```bash
file ~/.ssh/id_rsa3
file ~/.ssh/id_rsa3.pub
```

---

### 9. **Move the Private Key to the SSH Directory** 📂

Copy the private key to your `.ssh` directory:

```bash
cp -v /tmp/id_rsa3 ~/.ssh/
```

---

### 10. **SSH Without a Custom Key** 🚀

Use the default private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`):

```bash
ssh username@192.168.95.150
```

---

### 11. **Use a Specific Key with RSA Option** 🔑⚙️

Force use of the RSA algorithm with a custom key:

```bash
ssh -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa3 username@192.168.95.160
```

---

### 12. **Generate a DSA Key** 🖋️

> ⚠️ **DSA is deprecated** and should only be used for legacy compatibility.

- **Without Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t dsa -f /tmp/id_dsa -q -N ""
```

- **With Passphrase:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /tmp/id_dsa -q -N "nikhil123"
```

---

### 13. **Add DSA Public Key to Authorized Keys** 📜

```bash
cat /tmp/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

### 14. **Set Permissions on Authorized Keys** 🔒

```bash
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

### 15. **Example Private Key** 🔑

Save the below block into `~/.ssh/id_rsa_example` and secure it:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_example
```

```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
(Your RSA private key block here)
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

</details>

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🔐 Always secure your private keys with `chmod 600`.
- 🔐 Do **not** share private keys. Share **only** the public key (`.pub`).
- ✅ Use a passphrase if possible — skip it only for automation (e.g., scripts).
- ❌ Avoid DSA unless required for older systems.
