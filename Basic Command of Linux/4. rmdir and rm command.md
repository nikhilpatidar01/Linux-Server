# Linux `rmdir` and `rm` Commands with Examples

## 1. `rmdir` Command (Deleting an Empty Directory)

The **`rmdir`** command is used to delete an empty directory.

### Example:

```bash
$ rmdir d1
```

This command deletes the directory **`d1`**, but only if it is empty.

**Note:**  
- **`rmdir`** works only when the directory is completely empty, meaning it has no files or subdirectories.

---

## `rmdir -p` Command (Deleting with Parent Directories)

The **`rmdir -p`** command deletes a directory along with its parent directories, provided they are all empty.

### Example:

```bash
$ rmdir -p d7/d1/d2/d3/d4/d5
```

This command deletes **`d5`** along with its parent directories **`d4`**, **`d3`**, **`d2`**, **`d1`**, and **`d7`**, if they are all empty.

---

## 2. `rm` Command (Deleting Files)

The **`rm`** command is used to delete files, whether they contain data or not.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm f2.txt
```

This command deletes the file **`f2.txt`**.

---

## `rm -r` Command (Deleting a Directory and Its Contents)

The **`rm -r`** command is used to delete a directory along with all its files and subdirectories.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -r d4
```

This command deletes the **`d4`** directory along with all its contents.

---

## `rm -rv` Command (Verbose Deletion)

The **`rm -rv`** command deletes a directory and its contents while displaying verbose output.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -rv d4
```

**Output:**
```
removed directory: d4/subfolder1
removed directory: d4/subfolder2
removed file: d4/file1.txt
removed directory: d4
```

This command shows what files and directories are being deleted.

---

## `rm -rfv` Command (Force Delete with Verbose Output)

The **`rm -rfv`** command forcefully deletes a directory and its contents without prompting for confirmation while displaying the deleted items.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -rfv d4
```

This command deletes the **`d4`** directory and everything inside it forcefully.

---

## Deleting Specific Files with `rm -rfv`

You can use **`rm -rfv`** to delete multiple files at once.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -rfv maillog lastlog README wtmp
```

This command deletes **`maillog`**, **`lastlog`**, **`README`**, and **`wtmp`** files.

---

## `rm -rfv *` Command (Delete All Files and Directories)

The **`rm -rfv *`** command deletes all files and directories in the current directory.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -rfv *
```

This command deletes everything in the current directory. **Use this command with caution as it cannot be undone.**

---

## `rm -frv b*` Command (Delete Files and Directories Starting with "b")

The **`rm -frv b*`** command deletes all files and directories that start with the letter "b".

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -frv b*
```

This command deletes files and directories like **`banana.txt`**, **`b2.txt`**, etc.

---

## `rm -fv *.log` Command (Delete All `.log` Files)

The **`rm -fv *.log`** command deletes all files with the `.log` extension.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -fv *.log
```

This command deletes all **`.log`** files in the current directory.

---

## `rm -fv hel*` Command (Delete Files Starting with "hel")

The **`rm -fv hel*`** command deletes all files that start with **"hel"**.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -fv hel*
```

This command deletes files like **`help.txt`**, **`hello.txt`**, **`helw.txt`**, etc.

---

## `rm -fv hel??` Command (Delete Files with "hel" Followed by Two Characters)

The **`rm -fv hel??`** command deletes files that start with **"hel"** and are followed by exactly **two more characters**.

### Example:

```bash
$ rm -fv hel??
```

This command deletes files like **`hel01.txt`**, **`helw2.txt`**, but **not** `hel.txt` or `hello.txt` because they do not meet the two-character requirement.
