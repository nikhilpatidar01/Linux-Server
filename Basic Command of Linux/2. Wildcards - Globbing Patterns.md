### **1. Wildcards (Globbing Patterns)**  

Wildcards in Linux are used for pattern matching. They help identify and include files and directories in operations efficiently.  

#### **`rm -fv ma*` Command**  
This command deletes all files and directories that start with **"ma"**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -fv ma*
```
This command will delete files like **`ma`**, **`mark.txt`**, **`map.docx`**, etc.  

---

#### **`rm -f message?` Command**  
This command deletes files starting with **"message"** and followed by **one additional character**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -f message?
```
This command will delete files like **`message1`**, **`messageA`**, **`messageX`**, etc., but **not `message`** (as it has no extra character).  

---

#### **`rm -vf message[2-5]` Command**  
This command deletes files named **"message"** followed by numbers **2 to 5**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -vf message[2-5]
```
It will delete **`message2`**, **`message3`**, **`message4`**, and **`message5`**.  

---

#### **`rm -vf message[!1]` Command**  
This command deletes all files **starting with "message"** except the one ending with **"1"**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -vf message[!1]
```
This command will delete **`message2`**, **`message3`**, **`messageA`**, etc., but **not `message1`**.  

---

#### **`rm -vf message[1,3,5]` Command**  
This command deletes only the files **"message1"**, **"message3"**, and **"message5"**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -vf message[1,3,5]
```
It will delete **`message1`**, **`message3`**, and **`message5`**, but not **`message2`** or **`message4`**.  

---

#### **`rm -vf {.log, cron, message?}` Command**  
This command deletes files and directories matching **`.log`**, **`cron`**, and **`message?`**.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ rm -vf {.log, cron, message?}
```
This will delete **`.log`**, **`cron`**, and files like **`message1`**, **`messageA`**, etc., which have one extra character after `"message"`.
