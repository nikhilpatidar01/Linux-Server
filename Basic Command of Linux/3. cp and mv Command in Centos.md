# Linux Commands: `cp` and `mv` 🚀

## 1. `cp` Command (Copy Command) 📂

The **`cp`** command is used to copy one or more files from one location to another. It allows copying files from **a single or multiple sources** to **a single destination**.

### **Basic `cp` Command Example** ✨
You can copy a file to another file using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp Nikhilpatidar1 nikhilpatidar2
```
📌 This command will copy the file **`Nikhilpatidar1`** and save it as **`nikhilpatidar2`**.

---

### **`cp -v` Command (Verbose) 🔍**  
Using the **`-v`** (verbose) option, you can get detailed output of files being copied.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v nikhil Patidar indore d1/
```
📌 This command copies the files **`nikhil`**, **`Patidar`**, and **`indore`** into the **`d1`** directory while displaying details of the operation.

---

### **Copying Multiple Files to a Single Destination 📁**  
You can copy multiple source files to a single destination using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v /etc/password /etc/group /etc/gsadow root/desktop/d1/
```
📌 This command copies **`/etc/password`**, **`/etc/group`**, and **`/etc/gsadow`** files to the **`root/desktop/d1/`** directory.

---

### **Copying All Files from a Directory 📂**  
The command **`cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop`** tries to copy all files from a directory but does not copy subdirectories.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop
```
📌 This command copies all files from the **`/var/log/`** directory to **`root/desktop`**, but not the directories inside.

---

### **Copying with Recursive Option (`-r`) 🔄**  
If you need to copy a directory along with its subdirectories, use the **`-r`** (recursive) option.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* .
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the **current directory (`.`)**.  
📢 The **`-v`** (verbose) option provides details of each copied file and directory.

---

### **Copying Files to a Specific Directory 📤**  
The **`.`** symbol represents the **current directory**. If used as the destination, files will be copied to the current directory.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* ./desktop/d4/
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to **`./desktop/d4/`**.

---

### **Copying to the Root Directory 🏠**  
If you want to copy files to the root directory (`/`), root permissions are required.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/ /
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the root directory.

---

### **Copying to the Parent Directory Using `..` 🔙**  
The **`..`** symbol represents the **parent directory**. It is used to copy files one level up.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /etc/passed ../tmp/
```
📌 This command copies **`/etc/passed`** to the **parent directory (`../tmp/`)**.

---

## 2. `mv` Command (Move Command) 🚚

The **`mv`** command is used in Linux and Unix-based systems to **move (relocate) files or directories** or **rename them**.

### **Syntax:**
```bash
mv [options] source destination
```
1. **`source`**: The file or directory to be moved or renamed.
2. **`destination`**: The location where the file or directory should be moved, or the new name for renaming.

---

### **Basic Usage: 📝**

1. **Move a file to a directory:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 **Moves** `file.txt` to the `/home/user/Documents/` directory.

2. **Rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
   ```
   
   📌 **Renames** `old_name.txt` to `new_name.txt`.

3. **Move and rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/new_file.txt
   ```
   
   📌 **Moves** `file.txt` to `/home/user/Documents/` and **renames** it to `new_file.txt`.

---

### **Additional Options: ⚙️**

1. **`-i` (Interactive Mode) 🛑**: Prompts before overwriting a file.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -i old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 If `old_file.txt` already exists in the destination, confirmation is required before overwriting.

2. **`-f` (Force Mode) ⚡**: Overwrites files without prompting.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -f old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 If `old_file.txt` exists at the destination, it is overwritten without confirmation.

3. **`-u` (Update Mode) 🔄**: Moves the file only if the source is newer or the destination file does not exist.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -u file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 The file is moved only if the source is newer than the existing destination file or if the destination file does not exist.

Here's your updated version with more emojis for better readability! 😊

The `rename` command in Linux is used to rename multiple files at once using a pattern. Unlike `mv`, which renames a single file at a time, `rename` is useful for batch renaming.  

### **📌 Syntax:**  
```bash
rename [options] 's/old_pattern/new_pattern/' files
```
- 🔍 `s/old_pattern/new_pattern/` → This is a **Perl-style substitution** expression.  
- 📂 `files` → The list of files to rename.  

---

### **📌 Examples:**  

#### **1️⃣ Rename `.txt` files to `.bak`**  
```bash
rename 's/.txt$/.bak/' *.txt
```
✅ Changes:  
📄 `file1.txt` → 📝 `file1.bak`  
📄 `notes.txt` → 📝 `notes.bak`  

---

#### **2️⃣ Convert all filenames from UPPERCASE to lowercase**  
```bash
rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *
```
✅ Changes:  
📄 `File.TXT` → `file.txt`  
📄 `Document.DOC` → `document.doc`  

---

#### **3️⃣ Add a prefix to all `.jpg` files**  
```bash
rename 's/^/old_/' *.jpg
```
✅ Changes:  
🖼️ `photo.jpg` → `old_photo.jpg`  
🖼️ `image.jpg` → `old_image.jpg`  

---

#### **4️⃣ Replace spaces with underscores in filenames**  
```bash
rename 's/ /_/g' *
```
✅ Changes:  
📂 `my file.txt` → `my_file.txt`  
📂 `new document.doc` → `new_document.doc`  

---

### **🛠 Alternative: `mmv` Command**  
If `rename` is not installed, you can use `mmv`:  
```bash
mmv "*.txt" "#1_backup.txt"
```
✅ Changes:  
📄 `file1.txt` → `file1_backup.txt`  
📄 `notes.txt` → `notes_backup.txt`
