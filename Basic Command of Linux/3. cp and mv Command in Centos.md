# Linux Commands: `cp` and `mv` 🚀

## 1. `cp` Command (Copy Command) 📂

The **`cp`** command is used to copy one or more files from one location to another. It allows copying files from **a single or multiple sources** to **a single destination**.

### **Basic `cp` Command Example** ✨
You can copy a file to another file using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp Nikhilpatidar1 nikhilpatidar2
```
📌 This command will copy the file **`Nikhilpatidar1`** and save it as **`nikhilpatidar2`**.

---

### **`cp -v` Command (Verbose) 🔍**  
Using the **`-v`** (verbose) option, you can get detailed output of files being copied.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v nikhil Patidar indore d1/
```
📌 This command copies the files **`nikhil`**, **`Patidar`**, and **`indore`** into the **`d1`** directory while displaying details of the operation.

---

### **Copying Multiple Files to a Single Destination 📁**  
You can copy multiple source files to a single destination using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v /etc/password /etc/group /etc/gsadow root/desktop/d1/
```
📌 This command copies **`/etc/password`**, **`/etc/group`**, and **`/etc/gsadow`** files to the **`root/desktop/d1/`** directory.

---

### **Copying All Files from a Directory 📂**  
The command **`cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop`** tries to copy all files from a directory but does not copy subdirectories.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop
```
📌 This command copies all files from the **`/var/log/`** directory to **`root/desktop`**, but not the directories inside.

---

### **Copying with Recursive Option (`-r`) 🔄**  
If you need to copy a directory along with its subdirectories, use the **`-r`** (recursive) option.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* .
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the **current directory (`.`)**.  
📢 The **`-v`** (verbose) option provides details of each copied file and directory.

---

### **Copying Files to a Specific Directory 📤**  
The **`.`** symbol represents the **current directory**. If used as the destination, files will be copied to the current directory.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* ./desktop/d4/
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to **`./desktop/d4/`**.

---

### **Copying to the Root Directory 🏠**  
If you want to copy files to the root directory (`/`), root permissions are required.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/ /
```
📌 This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the root directory.

---

### **Copying to the Parent Directory Using `..` 🔙**  
The **`..`** symbol represents the **parent directory**. It is used to copy files one level up.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /etc/passed ../tmp/
```
📌 This command copies **`/etc/passed`** to the **parent directory (`../tmp/`)**.

---

## 2. `mv` Command (Move Command) 🚚

The **`mv`** command is used in Linux and Unix-based systems to **move (relocate) files or directories** or **rename them**.

### **Syntax:**
```bash
mv [options] source destination
```
1. **`source`**: The file or directory to be moved or renamed.
2. **`destination`**: The location where the file or directory should be moved, or the new name for renaming.

---

### **Basic Usage: 📝**

1. **Move a file to a directory:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 **Moves** `file.txt` to the `/home/user/Documents/` directory.

2. **Rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
   ```
   
   📌 **Renames** `old_name.txt` to `new_name.txt`.

3. **Move and rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/new_file.txt
   ```
   
   📌 **Moves** `file.txt` to `/home/user/Documents/` and **renames** it to `new_file.txt`.

---

### **Additional Options: ⚙️**

1. **`-i` (Interactive Mode) 🛑**: Prompts before overwriting a file.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -i old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 If `old_file.txt` already exists in the destination, confirmation is required before overwriting.

2. **`-f` (Force Mode) ⚡**: Overwrites files without prompting.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -f old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 If `old_file.txt` exists at the destination, it is overwritten without confirmation.

3. **`-u` (Update Mode) 🔄**: Moves the file only if the source is newer or the destination file does not exist.
   
   **Example:**  
   ```bash
   mv -u file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   📌 The file is moved only if the source is newer than the existing destination file or if the destination file does not exist.
