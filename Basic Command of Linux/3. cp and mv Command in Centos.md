# Linux Commands: `cp` and `mv`

## 1. `cp` Command (Copy Command)

The **`cp`** command is used to copy one or more files from one location to another. It allows copying files from **a single or multiple sources** to **a single destination**.

### **Basic `cp` Command Example**  
You can copy a file to another file using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp Nikhilpatidar1 nikhilpatidar2
```
This command will copy the file **`Nikhilpatidar1`** and save it as **`nikhilpatidar2`**.

---

### **`cp -v` Command (Verbose)**  
Using the **`-v`** (verbose) option, you can get detailed output of files being copied.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v nikhil Patidar indore d1/
```
This command copies the files **`nikhil`**, **`Patidar`**, and **`indore`** into the **`d1`** directory while displaying details of the operation.

---

### **Copying Multiple Files to a Single Destination**
You can copy multiple source files to a single destination using the **`cp`** command.  
**Example:**
```bash
$ cp -v /etc/password /etc/group /etc/gsadow root/desktop/d1/
```
This command copies **`/etc/password`**, **`/etc/group`**, and **`/etc/gsadow`** files to the **`root/desktop/d1/`** directory.

---

### **Copying All Files from a Directory**
The command **`cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop`** tries to copy all files from a directory but does not copy subdirectories.  
**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -v /var/log/* root/desktop
```
This command copies all files from the **`/var/log/`** directory to **`root/desktop`**, but not the directories inside.

---

### **Copying with Recursive Option (`-r`)**
If you need to copy a directory along with its subdirectories, use the **`-r`** (recursive) option.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* .
```
This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the **current directory (`.`)**.  
The **`-v`** (verbose) option provides details of each copied file and directory.

---

### **Copying Files to a Specific Directory**
The **`.`** symbol represents the **current directory**. If used as the destination, files will be copied to the current directory.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/* ./desktop/d4/
```
This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to **`./desktop/d4/`**.

---

### **Copying to the Root Directory**
If you want to copy files to the root directory (`/`), root permissions are required.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /var/log/ /
```
This command copies all files and directories from **`/var/log/`** to the root directory.

---

### **Copying to the Parent Directory Using `..`**
The **`..`** symbol represents the **parent directory**. It is used to copy files one level up.

**Example:**  
```bash
$ cp -vr /etc/passed ../tmp/
```
This command copies **`/etc/passed`** to the **parent directory (`../tmp/`)**.

---

## 2. `mv` Command (Move Command)

The **`mv`** command is used in Linux and Unix-based systems to **move (relocate) files or directories** or **rename them**.

### **Syntax:**
```bash
mv [options] source destination
```
1. **`source`**: The file or directory to be moved or renamed.
2. **`destination`**: The location where the file or directory should be moved, or the new name for renaming.

### **Basic Usage:**

1. **Move a file to a directory:**
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - Moves **`file.txt`** to the **`/home/user/Documents/`** directory.

2. **Rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - Renames **`old_name.txt`** to **`new_name.txt`**.

3. **Move and rename a file:**
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/new_file.txt
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - Moves **`file.txt`** to **`/home/user/Documents/`** and renames it to **`new_file.txt`**.

---

### **Additional Options:**

1. **`-i` (Interactive Mode)**: Prompts before overwriting a file.
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv -i old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   **Explanation:** If **`old_file.txt`** already exists in the destination, confirmation is required before overwriting.

2. **`-f` (Force Mode)**: Overwrites files without prompting.
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv -f old_file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   **Explanation:** If **`old_file.txt`** exists at the destination, it is overwritten without confirmation.

3. **`-u` (Update Mode)**: Moves the file only if the source is newer or the destination file does not exist.
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   mv -u file.txt /home/user/Documents/
   ```
   
   **Explanation:** The file is moved only if the source is newer than the existing destination file or if the destination file does not exist.
